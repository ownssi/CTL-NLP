As a result of the initiative, faculty and students have a shared understanding of the purpose of the major and what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study. The initiative is in keeping with the fundamental principle at Berkeley that the evaluation of student achievement should be locally defined, discipline specific, and faculty-driven.\n\n\nDepartment of Architecture Statement of Goals\n\n\nThe Underlying Goals of a Liberal Arts Undergraduate Education\n\n\nIn its recent curriculum discussions, the faculty strongly supports a liberal arts education for undergraduates that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the department is that all courses are framed with this perspective. In addition to this goal, the department is introducing students to the discipline specific areas of knowledge that are needed by students who apply for graduate school in architecture.\n\n\nThe Discipline-Specific Knowledge of Architecture\n\n\nThe discipline of architecture covers a wide range of discipline-specific subject areas that are integrated in the process of design.\n\n\nThe goal of the undergraduate major is to make students familiar with and curious about engagement in and production of the built environment in historical, critical, technical, and social dimensions. The possibilities open to graduates in the major are broad, and this challenges the department to locate the terrain that is common to various aspects of the discipline as a formulation of the core lower division courses, and then to offer at the upper division a set of \u201cstreams\u201d of study, each of which inspires and prepares students to pursue a future endeavor. As these future endeavors cover a wide range of possibilities, there are several ways to view the undergraduate major: as a liberal arts education through the lens of architecture, perhaps leading to another course of study; as preparation for work in the profession with only an undergraduate degree; and as preparation for follow-up study at the graduate level in the discipline of architecture. Acceptance into strong graduate architecture programs requires a high level of proficiency in the core areas of the curriculum. In recent debates on the undergraduate curriculum, the faculty decided that the undergraduate major should continue to provide courses appropriate for students on each of these paths.\n\n\nThe curriculum exposes students to five aspects of architecture and the broader field of environmental design:\n\n\n\nThe Language of Architecture\n\tIn essence, the language most particular to architecture is a graphic vocabulary that is the currency of exploration in the design studio. The mastery of this language, like the learning of any language, begins with vocabulary and grammar, and then moves on to the construction of meaning. This latter aspect is rigorously pursued in the design studio, and for those planning to go on to graduate study in architecture, a number of these upper level studios offer an increasingly complex set of design challenges.\n\tIn the Language of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nUnderstand the conventions of plan, section, elevation, and axonometric and their relationship to each other;\nUnderstand and become proficient in hand drawings and the use of digital media in the production of these conventions;\nUnderstand and become proficient in three or four digital programs that allow a facile exploration of design ideas;\nBecome proficient in the production of design iterations; and\nApply critical discussion to design solutions and representation.\n\n\nThe History and Theory of Architecture\n\tCourses in history and theory are intended to familiarize students with the development of the built environment in both western and eastern traditions, and to introduce recent and current theories of local and global importance. The introductory surveys in architectural history test students to both recognize and classify architectural styles; these courses are complemented by others that focus on the intersection of history and theory, and for which the writing of papers is the primary means of evaluation.\n\tIn the History and Theory of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nArticulate the theoretical concepts within the design studio projects;\nUnderstand the major periods and styles in architectural history;\nUnderstand the modern period, and its current debates; and\nWrite critical papers comparing and contrasting both buildings and ideas.\n\n\nThe Humanistic Applications of Architecture\n\tMany students enter this field of study in hopes of improving the conditions of the built environment as it relates to the daily life of individuals and communities. An emphasis in these aspects of the major can lead to graduate work in other disciplines, including environmental studies, law, global development and planning, and anthropology, or to a PhD program in architecture.\n\tIn the Humanistic Applications of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nUnderstand the roles and responsibilities of the environmental professions;\nUnderstand the art and science of interpreting the social context of design;\nIdentify the major issues of environmental design in the national and global setting; and\nRecognize the value of addressing sustainability at all levels of design.\n\n\nThe Science and Technology of Architecture\n\tHow buildings stand up, how they operate to distribute and control light and air, and the materials and connections with which they are made bring the understanding of the discipline from its paper representations of design and theory into the physical world. A set of core courses introduces students to the fundamentals of these areas, and a set of upper division seminars allows more in-depth explorations of aspects of each, including the testing of structural ideas through design, current attitudes and goals for a sustainable building culture, and construction practices particular to certain materials or cultures.\u00a0\n\tIn the Science and Technology of Architecture, student should learn to:\n\t\nEvaluate building performance through modes of calculation;\nFamiliarize themselves with the major groups of construction systems;\nIntegrate these concepts into the design studio; and\nFamiliarize themselves with the major debates in the literature of these areas.\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\tStudents should become proficient in the processes of academic research, learning to:\n\t\nUndertake library and on-line research and follow source threads to both books and periodicals;\nConstruct bibliographies to academic standards;\nDocument various methods of research; and\nUnderstand taxonomies of knowledge and organize information.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"art-history","text":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nLower Division:\n\n\n\nStudents are introduced to principles of visual analysis.\nLearn to think about images within a historical and cultural context.\nLearn to craft coherent arguments about works of art by integrating visual analysis with historical\/cultural context.\nDevelop familiarity with specific sites, objects, artists, cultures, and facts pertaining to them.\nStudents learn to understand techniques and skills used in the creation of works of art.\n\n\n\nUpper Division:\n\n\n\nStudents\u2019 skills in all of the above are reinforced.\nThey learn to analyze key texts relating to the artworks under discussion.\nWrite longer papers that include research.\nUnderstand in depth the dynamic relationship between visual art and its historical, social, cultural, economic, and political contexts.\nIn small seminars, students pursue independent research projects.\nUndertake intensive interrogations of particular problems in the history of art.\nIn History of Art courses,\u00a0HISTART\u00a0100\u00a0and HISTART\u00a0101, students come to understand the history and tools of the discipline.\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"asian-american-diaspora-studies","text":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nUndergraduates are expected to obtain the following skills by the time they graduate.

The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.\n\n\nLEARNING GOALS\n\n\nThe foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.\n\n\nNuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:\n\n\n\nApply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.\nDemonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and\/or future importance to society.\nExhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and\u00a0problem-solving\u00a0skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.\nDemonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.\nValue and practice life-long learning.\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"english","text":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nMission\n\n\nThe study of literature is not about canonical books or established facts, but about a process of interpretation and analysis, a process that begins in the classroom and develops over a lifetime.

Because most of the Earth's interior is inaccessible to direct observation, the geophysicist uses the basic principles of physics to devise indirect methods of exploring those parts of the Earth that cannot be reached by shovel or drill bit. Measurements of magnetic fields, electric potential, gravity, seismic waves, and satellite-based geodesy are used to probe the interior and study surface and internal processes of our planet, and to answer questions concerning how continents move, mountains form, earthquakes shake, and volcanoes erupt, as well as improving our understanding of planetary to local scale structure and processes. These questions require an interdisciplinary approach that links the disciplines of mathematics, physics, geology, and chemistry. Moreover, the geophysics study encompasses theoretical and experimental science as well as fieldwork to study geodynamic processes and the structure of the Earth and other planets, and employed methods are used for identification and recovery of natural resources, the characterization of natural hazards from earthquakes and volcanoes, and are used for environmental studies and remediation.\n\n\n"},{"major":"german","text":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\n\n\nMission\nThe Bachelor\u2019s Degree Program offers a comprehensive education in German Studies.

The Legal Studies curriculum examines how law shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces. The major is designed to stimulate critical understanding of and inquiry about the theoretical frameworks, historical dynamics, and cultural embeddedness of law.\n\n\nThe Legal Studies faculty and students grapple with important questions of social policy within the framework of significant concerns in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These concerns include individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy; political and social equality; the just distribution of resources and opportunities within society; the relationship between citizens and the state; democratic participation and representation; the moral commitments of the community; and the preservation of human dignity.\n\n\nThe major\u2019s course offerings examine law and legality from both humanist and empirical perspectives. Courses are organized into interdisciplinary topical areas that transcend disciplinary boundaries in the interest of collaborative inquiry.\n\n\nLegal Studies\u2019 Pedagogic Objectives\n\n\nConvey how law relates to social context: \u00a0Students will learn about the transformation of legal processes and systems across time and space (e.g., globalization, transnational processes). They will also study how law shapes and is shaped by economic, political, and cultural forces, as well as how and why law in action often differs from legal doctrine.\n\n\nAdopt an explicitly interdisciplinary approach:\u00a0 Students will focus on pervasive problems of legal and social policy across traditional curricular and disciplinary boundaries. Although the program encompasses multiple disciplinary perspectives (e.g., history, economics, sociology), it is designed to transcend academic identities rather than compartmentalize the study of law into the discrete perspectives of established disciplines. To accomplish this integration, the major is organized around areas of focus that explore common themes but include coursework across disciplinary boundaries.\n\n\nIntegrate empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives: Students will be exposed to both empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives on law and legal institutions through distribution requirements within the major. Empirical perspectives encompass public policy analysis, training in the epistemological commitments of social science (e.g., empirical methods, the logic of social inquiry), and familiarity with the central questions and tenets related to law in disciplines such as economics, sociology, and political science. Humanities perspectives include maintaining the program\u2019s historical focus on clarifying fundamental values, examining philosophical questions related to law, and understanding the operation and effects of social and cultural practices as they relate to law, legal institutions, and the phenomenon they regulate. After students fulfill the basic distribution requirements, they may, but will not be required to, concentrate their efforts in either empirical or humanities-oriented perspectives.\n\n\nPromote engagement with social policy: Students will be encouraged to engage deeply with social policy guided by significant themes in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These themes include individual liberty, privacy, democracy, and the relationship between the citizen and the state. Engaging with these themes ensures that policy studies are basic and critical, rather than confined to preexisting policy formulations and assumptions. This new objective of engagement with social policy is intended to connect humanistic inquiries regarding justice, morality, and values, with empirical inquiries into patterns of social behavior and the effects of law on society. This goal will be accomplished through both coursework and field work options.\n\n\nEncourage civic engagement and an appreciation of the values at stake in legal concerns:\u00a0 Consistent with the mission of a public university, the major will develop informed and engaged citizens with sufficient knowledge and background to participate in civic institutions and the development of law and policy during and after their education at Berkeley. This participation could take many forms, including interacting with public officials, joining the legal profession, working for legal institutions, engaging in policy analysis, advocacy, social movement building, community organizing, political activism, and the like. Civic engagement includes confronting the relationship between law and justice, and understanding how law affects the public interest and social utility.\n\n\nProvide a liberal arts education: The major will continue to have a liberal arts orientation. Students will learn to analyze and understand legal rules and legal institutions, but from a broader perspective than is typically taught in a traditional law school setting.\n\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nThe faculty strongly supports an undergraduate liberal arts education that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the program is that courses be framed with this perspective. In addition, the program is committed to introducing students to multiple disciplinary approaches to the study of law and legal institutions, as well as conveying important basic knowledge about the core features of the American legal system.\n\n\nCritical Thinking Skills\n\n\nIn concert with the goals identified above, these critical thinking skills focus on particular forms of analysis central to engaging with law and legal institutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\n\n\n\nIdentify and evaluate arguments, synthesize ideas, and develop well-substantiated, coherent, and concise arguments, whether in oral or written form.\nIdentify and follow a logical sequence or argument through to its end; recognize faulty reasoning.\nDevelop the ability to critically evaluate proposed legal reforms and policies.\nDevelop the ability to formulate generalized, abstract principles in a way that clarifies the major issues at stake and identifies the most relevant elements of a concept or text.\nPromote exploration of the role of law in American society from both social science and humanities perspectives.\nLearn to draw from multiple disciplinary approaches and fields of study across philosophy, history, economics, political science, and sociology; synthesize, bridge, and question disciplinary boundaries to identify new inquiries or insights.\n\n\n\nBasic Knowledge about Law and Legal Institutions\n\n\nThese goals address important basic knowledge about law and legal institutions that the program seeks to convey. These goals are not intended to provide a pre-professional education but instead to produce citizens literate in the basic functions and structure of legal systems.\n\n\n\nUnderstand core theories about the relationship between law and society.\nBe introduced to core features of the American legal system.\nUnderstand basic legal terminology, legal concepts, legal actors, and modes of legal reasoning.\nBecome acquainted with legal systems other than our own, including how they compare to the current American legal system.\nDevelop insights into how law has evolved through time, including the temporal and geographical transformation of legal processes and systems.\n\n\n\nEngaged Citizenship\n\n\nThe faculty believes that our role as a program in a public institution should include training students to be engaged, active, and critical citizens in our society. Many legal studies students engage in civic participation and service while at Berkeley, and many go on to careers in public service. We seek to develop more opportunities for students to develop practical skills and knowledge relevant to those experiences in addition to the broader intellectual skills conveyed by a liberal arts education.\n\n\n\nExperience the law in action through service learning, exposure to legal clinics, problem solving, and social policy engagement.\nEnable civic engagement and participation in developing and critiquing social policy.\n\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nA key part of a liberal arts education is learning how to conduct independent research and analysis. The program seeks to expose students to a multidisciplinary range of methods of research.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDevelop an understanding of methods of research and forms of evidence across multiple disciplines.\nDevelop skills necessary to find and to assess relevant jurisprudential, social science, and humanities materials related to law and legal institutions.\nDevelop basic abilities in statistical analysis and reasoning.\nUnderstand the logic of inquiry in the social sciences.\n\n\n\nHumanities\n\n\n(Defined as philosophy, political theory, and history.)\n\n\n\u00a0These goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the humanities as they relate to law and legal institutions.\n\n\n\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on fundamental normative concepts such as fairness, due process, equality, and utility.\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on rights, duties, punishment, and justice.\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on the ethical dimensions of the relationship between citizens and the state, and the forms and limits of sovereignty.\nUnderstand the historical contexts and forces within which legal systems operate and how legal systems influence history and societies.\n\n\n\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n(Defined as sociology, political science, psychology and economics.)\n\n\nThese goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the social sciences as they relate to law and legal institutions.\n\n\n\nDevelop the ability to connect theory about law and legal institutions with empirical predictions about the state of the world and to evaluate those predictions with data.\nUnderstand how, and why, the law in action often differs from the law on the books.\nDevelop an expansive understanding of the social contexts in which law and legal institutions can be studied empirically.\n\n\n\nPlease visit our website at http:\/\/legalstudies.berkeley.edu\n\n\n"},{"major":"linguistics","text":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals of the Major\n\n\nIn addition to attaining a basic mastery of the field of linguistics, linguistics majors develop skills in critical thinking, communication, and the use of research methodologies.

This initiative is designed to promote and facilitate learning for undergraduates across campus. In connection with this initiative, the Philosophy Department has articulated the following goals for our undergraduate majors.\n\n\nThe primary goal that we expect our undergraduate philosophy majors to achieve is to become capable of engaging with the main topics and issues in contemporary academic philosophy and with the historical tradition by which contemporary philosophy is informed. Students who graduate from our program should be able to think both analytically and creatively about philosophical issues and texts. They should be able to analyse and raise objections to philosophical views and arguments that are presented to them, and to develop and defend their own views on philosophical topics. They should be able to do this both in writing and in oral discussion with other students and with instructors. Achieving these objectives requires that students acquire more general skills in writing, reading, and oral argument: they need to be able to organize their ideas, express them clearly both in writing and in speaking, and construct plausible arguments in their defense.\n\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nThis primary goal includes the following more specific goals:\n\n\n\nA broad general understanding of the work of major figures in the history of philosophy, including Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant.\nA deeper and more detailed understanding of the work of at least two historically important philosophers.\nFamiliarity with the most important topics in a range of areas which are typically regarded as lying at the center of contemporary philosophical thought, including metaphysics, theory of knowledge, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.\nFamiliarity with the most important topics in ethics and the related field of political philosophy.\nFamiliarity with formal logic, including both the ability to understand the logical symbolism used in many contemporary philosophical texts, and to carry out logical proofs and derivations within a formal system.\nThe general capacity to think analytically and creatively about philosophical texts and issues.\nThe general capacity to express philosophical ideas and defend them effectively in argument, both in writing and orally.\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nStudents\u2019 attainment of these goals is measured by assessment of their performance in the courses required for the major. All philosophy undergraduate courses, with the exception of those in logic, require students to write several essays over the course of the semester; many of them also require a final exam where the questions also take the form of short philosophical essays. These essays are evaluated by the instructor with an eye both to the student\u2019s mastery of the specific subject matter covered by the course, and to the student\u2019s mastery of more general skills in philosophical thinking and writing. A higher standard of thinking and writing is required for upper division than for lower division courses. More ambitious students have the option of taking graduate seminars as electives, where the standard for philosophical writing is higher still.\n\n\nIn logic courses, students\u2019 competence in formal logic is evaluated through assessment of their performance in weekly problem sets and examinations (typically including a midterm and a final).\n\n\nAll of our courses, again with the exception of those in formal logic, require students to engage in oral philosophical discussion, typically during sections taught by graduate student instructors. In many courses, students\u2019 contributions to discussion are assessed as part of the overall assessment of their performance in the class.

We think it very important that students have the opportunity to develop their skills in oral discussion of philosophical issues, and we are hoping to be able to introduce as a requirement that students take one undergraduate seminar which offers ample opportunity for discussion with a faculty member and with their peers.

These topics are traditionally broadly divided into classical and modern physics. Some core topics, such as special relativity, classical optics, and classical thermodynamics, are covered only in lower division courses. Other topics, such as quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and optics, are covered first at an introductory level in lower division and then at a more advanced level in the upper division courses. Advanced elective courses provide students the opportunity to further their knowledge in specific areas (such as atomic physics, condensed matter physics, optical properties, quantum computing, biophysics, astrophysics, particle physics). A two-semester upper division laboratory course provides additional training in electronic instrumentation, circuits, computer interfacing to experiments, independent project design, and advanced laboratory techniques experiments. This laboratory course also provides the capstone experience to the core courses, bringing the knowledge gained in different courses together and making the connection between theoretical knowledge taught in textbooks\/homework problems and the experimental foundations of this knowledge. Activities outside the classroom, such as independent research or study, allow students to further develop their knowledge and understanding.\n\n\nA student graduating from Berkeley with a major in physics will understand classical and modern physics (as outlined in the course requirements below) and will also acquire the skills to apply principles to new and unfamiliar problems.

The program is rich in extra- and co-curricular resources, including speakers and scholar\/artists in residence, study abroad opportunities, and international internships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConcentration Requirements\n\nConcentrators must take either AFST\u00a0H101, \u201cIntroduction to African and Africana Studies\u201d (Haverford College) or HIST\u00a0B102, \u201cIntroduction to Africana Civilizations\u201d (BMC).\nOther than the required introductory course, students must complete five additional courses from a list approved by the concentration coordinator.\nAt least two, and no more than three, courses must be completed in the departmental major.\nAt least three African and Africana Studies courses must be taken in at least two departments outside of the major.\nAt least one of the required courses must deal with the African diaspora.\nConcentrators must complete either a senior thesis or seminar-length essay in an area of African and Africana Studies.\n\nStudents majoring in a department that requires a thesis satisfy therequirement by writing on a topic approved by their department and by the coordinator(s) of the African and Africana Studies program. If the major department does not require a thesis, an equivalent written exercise that is a seminar-length essay is required. The essay may be written within the framework of a particular course or as an independent study project. The topic must be approved by the instructor in question and by the coordinator(s) of the African and Africana Studies program. Successful completion of the African and Africana Studies minor\/concentration is noted on students\u2019 final transcripts. \u00a0\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Anthropology","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nThrough a broad range of classes and co-curricular opportunities, our students develop a deep understanding of the discipline of anthropology\u2014the theories that have shaped it, the range of subfields it possesses, and the unique contributions and relevancy of the field. They also cultivate the tools to conduct ethnographic research and collect data with rigor and respect.\nOur required curriculum for majors spans from introductory classes to advanced independent work. Beginning with Introduction to Anthropology taken in the first or second year, students progress through classes at the 200- and 300-level. Our required History and Theory of Anthropology course explores the development of anthropological thought. We also require majors to explore a particular ethnographic area\u2014such as Africa or China\u2014through a 200-level class. For majors, the academic experience culminates in their senior year with the development and writing of a senior thesis. Students in the major build a rich course of study drawing on our wide range of classes, involved student community, and faculty known for their scholarship as well as their mentorship and engagement in contemporary issues.\nOur required curriculum for minors begins with Introduction to Anthropology taken in the first or second year. Minors also take History and Theory of Anthropology, one 200-level class that explores a particular ethnographic area (such as Africa or China, and three other courses at the 200- or 300-level. Students in the minor build a rich course of study drawing on our wide range of classes, involved student community, and faculty known for their scholarship as well as their mentorship and engagement in contemporary issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nStudents are required to take a total of 11 courses in the major, including 6 required courses within the department. Individual programs require the advisor\u2019s approval.\n\nANTH\u00a0H103, Introduction to Anthropology, preferably in the first or second year.\nANTH\u00a0H303, History and Theory of Anthropology, before the senior year.\nOne course focused on an ethnographic or geographic area or a cohesive non-geographically specific field.\nOne other 200-level course in this department.\nOne other 300-level course in this department.\nFour additional courses approved by your major advisor.\nA two-credit, intensive Senior Thesis Seminar, during the fall and spring semesters of the senior year (ANTH\u00a0H450 and ANTH\u00a0H451).\n\nAll major programs require the approval of the major advisor. Students may count no more than one biological anthropology or archaeology course for the Haverford major. Students must take the remaining courses in the Haverford Anthropology Department, in an anthropology department within the Tri-Co or at Penn. Taking courses to count toward the major outside of Haverford\u2019s Anthropology Department, outside of the discipline, or while studying abroad requires approval of the student\u2019s advisor. Typically no more than two courses from outside of Tri-Co anthropology that relate to the student\u2019s specific interests are counted towards the major though this can be discussed with the advisor in special cases.\nSenior Project\nThe anthropology thesis is a year-long, two-credit independent research project designed and implemented by each senior anthropology major. Each student selects a research topic, defines a specific research question, describes how that question relates to a broader field of ethnographic and anthropological writing on the topic, conducts independent, original research with primary source materials that can be ethnographic, archival, and\/or material, and develops and writes up an original argument, supported by evidence, about the primary source materials. This argument is informed by the relevant theory and by ethnographic and anthropological scholarship. Thus, a successful anthropology thesis will provide substantial evidence that students are able to conduct independent research and synthesize theoretical arguments with ethnographic materials, as well as displaying strong skills in presenting their research, and entering into intellectual dialogue with peers and faculty.\nThe senior thesis consists of two courses, ANTH\u00a0H450 and ANTH\u00a0H451. Anthropology 450 is a seminar course taught during the fall semester, typically by one faculty member who receives one teaching credit. For ANTH H450, students define their research question, write and rewrite a research prospectus, do ethnographic exercises, study professional ethics, familiarize themselves with IRBs, and conclude with a literature review of their topic. ANTH H451 is supervised research and writing. A faculty member receives one credit for supervising four to six senior theses. During ANTH H450, each student does guided research on their topic, drafts and writes a thesis, and does a public presentation of their thesis research, and takes an oral comprehensive exam.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\n\nDefine an anthropological research question.\nSituate their research question in a broader field of anthropological and scholarly inquiry.\nConduct research with primary source materials (archival, ethnographic, and\/or material).\nDevelop an original argument about their primary source materials that is informed by relevant theory and anthropological literature.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nFor ANTH H450, students are assessed on a preliminary research proposal, a research prospectus, a literature review draft, a research presentation, and a literature review, as well as short in-class methodological exercises. For ANTH H451, students are assessed on their final thesis, public presentation, and oral exam. Two faculty members read and comment on each thesis. All faculty attend and evaluate the public presentations and the oral exams. The faculty collectively assign each student\u2019s final grade for the course, as well as each of the three components (thesis, public presentation, and oral exam). The thesis also plays an important role in whether or not a student receives honors or highest honors in Anthropology.\nRequirements for Honors\nThe faculty in the Department of Anthropology decides honors based upon overall excellence in the major:\n\nOutstanding work in the senior thesis (final written work and oral presentation).\nStrong cumulative performance in all anthropological coursework (typically a grade point average of 3.7 or higher).\nA record of consistent intellectual commitment and participation in the department.\n\nFaculty awards high honors upon occasion, for exceptional contributions in all three areas.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nThe minor in anthropology consists of six courses, including:\n\nANTH\u00a0H103, Introduction to Anthropology\nANTH\u00a0H303, History and Theory of Anthropology\nAn ethnographic area course\nThree other courses at the 200 or 300 level, including one course at the 300 level.\n\nMinors must take a minimum of three courses in the Haverford department.

In lieu of specific required courses, the curriculum offers a balance of structure and rigor with reasonable flexibility in possible pathways for completing the minor. The Co-Directors of Asian American Studies will help students select courses that meet the requirements for the minor. Students\u2019 minor experience will culminate with an annual Tri-College Asian American Studies symposium where seniors will present their work in various forms (e.g., music performance, poster presentation), reflecting the highly interdisciplinary nature of the program.\nStudents interested in the Asian American Studies Minor should plan their course schedule in consultation with one of the Co-Directors of Asian American Studies (one located at Haverford\/Bryn Mawr, one located at Swarthmore).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nThe 6-credit minor is composed of the following requirements:\n\n\nAt least 3 \u201cCore Courses\u201d in Asian American Studies. These courses have a substantive focus on Asian American experiences, histories, and cultures. Please find a current list of approved courses on the Asian American Studies website.\n\n\nAt least 1 Course in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies. These courses provide exposure to the experiences, histories, and cultures of other racial and ethnic groups in and of themselves, or in relation to other groups.

They teach courses at every level while advancing cutting-edge research in partnership with students in their labs.\nBiology majors pursue a program of interconnected classroom and lab work. In preparation for the biology curriculum, students must complete a natural science course (with lab) in the freshman year. Sophomores enroll in a year-long combined lab and lecture course, Biology 200, which introduces cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, cellular metabolism, and cellular regulation. As juniors, they complete multiple half- semester courses covering key topics in greater depth and take the department\u2019s signature \u201cSuperlab\u201d class. In this intensive year-long lab, they investigate significant research questions in half-semester modules. For majors, this is vital firsthand experience using leading-edge research techniques in the context of current biological questions and theories. The curriculum is also flexible enough to allow majors to study abroad in their junior year. In their senior year, majors expand their critical and creative abilities through advanced-level seminar courses in which they explore contemporary developments in a particular area of biology. They also develop and write a research-based thesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\n\nBoth semesters of BIOL\u00a0H200\u00a0and BIOL\u00a0H201. Successful completion of a one-credit natural science course (which includes a laboratory experience) at Haverford, Bryn Mawr or Swarthmore College is a prerequisite for enrolling in BIOL H200.\nA minimum of a one-credit chemistry course (with associated lab).\nAt least one semester of advanced coursework (200 level or higher) in a natural sciences course outside the biology department. Courses crosslisted in biology may not be counted toward this requirement.\nTwo semesters of the junior laboratory, BIOL\u00a0H300 and BIOL\u00a0H301.\nFour half-semester 300-level advanced topics courses (selected from BIOL H311-H329). Occasionally, an upper-level course from Bryn Mawr or Swarthmore may substitute for one or two of the half-semester lecture courses, but only with the specific permission of the student\u2019s major advisor. Students are encouraged to take additional topics classes beyond the minimum of four to enhance their biology experience.\nOne half-semester 450-level seminar course in the Haverford Biology Department (chosen from BIOL H450-H463-; no substitutions permitted). Students may take additional seminar courses to enrich their knowledge of the discipline.\nA minimum of two 400-level Senior Research Tutorial credits, generally taken over both semesters of the senior year, including active participation in weekly lab meetings and submission of a notebook and a thesis describing the progress and results of the project. The tutorial may be taken for single or double credit each semester.\nSenior Department Studies, BIOL\u00a0H499.\n\nIn addition to the required courses, the Biology Department strongly recommends a year of physics, a course in probability and statistics, and advanced coursework in another natural science department.\nDepartment policy is to limit study abroad biology major credit to a maximum of two 31X\/32X\u00a0courses and one Superlab quarter (with\u00a0rare exceptions of a full semester Superlab credit).\nSenior Project\nThe senior thesis is a major component of a year-long research experience that is the capstone of the Biology major at Haverford. The process begins in the junior year, when students and faculty work together to distribute students evenly across all the available Senior Research Tutorials for the following year (each faculty member normally supervises four to six students in all).\nDuring the senior year students enroll in a Senior Research Tutorial (numbered BIOL H401-H411,\u00a0depending on the faculty mentor) which is taken for a minimum of one credit in each semester of the senior year. The Senior Research Tutorial involves 10 hours of laboratory work per week per credit, and is completed under the guidance of a faculty mentor.\u00a0 Students may elect to increase their commitment to their research project by enrolling in 1.5 or 2 credits of Senior Research per semester, for up to four credits in the senior year. In addition, all seniors must take Senior Departmental Studies (BIOL\u00a0H499), which is a pass\/fail, half-credit course taken for a full year in parallel with their Senior Research. This senior seminar course provides an opportunity for all majors to be trained in lab safety, hear invited seminar speakers, and to present thesis proposals as well as the results of senior research work.\nThesis Content\nFall Semester\nIn the fall, all senior majors complete at least one credit of Senior Research Tutorial during which they begin an original research project that will be continued throughout the year. In the Senior Research Tutorial, students participate in weekly laboratory meetings, keep a laboratory notebook as a record of their work, and interpret and analyze their data. In the fall semester students write a formal project proposal and also present their proposal as a short talk to the department during Senior Departmental Studies.\nSpring Semester\nIn the spring, all majors complete a second semester of Senior Research Tutorial and participate in Senior Departmental Studies. Students continue the research projects started in the fall under the guidance of their faculty mentor. Senior majors write a final thesis and present a scientific poster describing the results of their research project. They submit their lab notebook as a permanent record of the work they have completed in the lab.\nThesis Preparation (prior to senior year)\nPreparation for thesis research begins with the introductory course for biology majors, BIOL\u00a0H200\/BIOL\u00a0H201, and builds in each course thereafter, so that all of the departmental learning goals are consistently reinforced. For example, all students in laboratory courses (such as BIOL H200\/H201\u00a0and BIOL H300\/H301\u00a0) work with a lab partner or in small groups so that they learn to work collaboratively. At the same time, students are also called upon to present their work individually and to maintain their own research lab notebooks, so that they learn to work independently and are responsible for all parts of the project. The students participate in directed journal clubs in BIOL H200\/H201 and majors in upper-level courses read and critique research papers from the original scientific literature, presenting their analyses to the class.\nThe BIOL H31x\/H32X courses, typically taken during the junior year, are based on current research in biology, with an emphasis on integrating this information into a broader understanding of biological topics. The primary focus in these courses is not simply the information itself but rather on how it was determined experimentally. This emphasis provides the students with the skills needed to understand how research is done.\nBIOL\u00a0H300\/BIOL\u00a0H301, the junior-level laboratory course, is intentionally modeled on the work that students are expected to conduct for their senior research thesis, and can be described as a class-based research experience. The emphasis in this year\u00adlong course, which is required for all Biology majors, includes the acquisition of new research techniques but places greater emphasis on hypothesis\u2014testing, data analysis, experimental troubleshooting, record keeping, and oral and written presentations. The projects in BIOL H300\/H301 are designed to be intellectually open-\u00adended; students share results and insights, and work to understand the current literature and to connect their findings to what is already known.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe learning goals for the senior thesis include:\n\nincreasing intellectual independence and initiative.\ndeveloping creativity and rigor in experimental design, execution, and interpretation.\nensuring reproducibility of experimental results, accurate record keeping, and productivity.\nunderstanding and participating in collaborative and ethical conduct of research\nlearning to present research orally, visually, and in writing.\n\nThese are criteria by which the department can assess the students\u2019 maturation as scholars.\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe department has developed criteria for evaluating the research proposal and thesis, as well as a grading rubric that is distributed to students at the start of their senior year (available on the departmental website).\u00a0 Each faculty member plays a role in the assessment of senior work, which consists of:\n\nfaculty supervision of weekly laboratory work that includes maintenance of laboratory notebook and participation in lab meetings.\nformal project proposal, including written proposal, and oral presentation to the department in the fall.\nposter presentation summarizing research results in the spring semester.\nevaluation of written thesis based on set criteria and grading rubric provided to students at start of senior year.\n\nSee the Biology Department website for detailed grading guidelines and standards used in evaluating the senior project (PDF download).\nRequirements for Honors\nDue to concerns about equity and fairness regarding the use of GPAs to make distinctions between students, the department does not award GPA-based honors in biology. We do, however, award graduation prizes in biology to recognize growth and accomplishment within the major.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nBiochemistry Concentration \nBiophysics Concentration \n\n\n"},{"major":"Biophysics","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur curriculum varies depending on the particular concentration each student chooses to pursue.

First, all seniors enroll in CHEM\u00a0H391 Departmental Seminar, a year-long seminar course.\u00a0 Second, all seniors enroll in at least one credit of research, either experimental, computational or literature-based. The course numbers for research as specific to the faculty advisors, often with a CHEM H36x designation. CHEM H36x work involves the design, articulation and conduction of an independent research project. Students are expected to be in the laboratory for at least 15 hours per week performing experiments, analyzing data and designing future experiments. Additional activities include participation in research group meeting, where data, experiments and literature articles are discussed. Each student prepares a formal document (the \"senior thesis\" at the end of their spring semester detailing their work in the Senior Project.\nCHEM H391 exposes students to chemistry through talks by chemists from other institutions and provides enrolled students with opportunities to present their own work formally.\u00a0 Each student prepares and delivers both an oral and poster presentation. The oral presentations occur throughout the academic year, and the poster presentations occur in April. The audience for these presentations is all chemistry seniors, underclass students involved in research, post-doctoral fellows and the faculty in chemistry.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nIdentify and describe research methods used to probe specific chemical motifs.\n\nThis learning objective involves the correct use various instrumental analyses in the full characterization of different reaction types. This learning objective most likely fits into the junior level CHEM\u00a0H301\/CHEM\u00a0H302 Lab in Chemical Structure and Reactivity (Superlab). \u00a0\n\nDesign and articulate an independent research project.\n\nThis learning objective is designed to probe a student\u2019s ability to digest the chemical literature, formulate new ideas and articulate them clearly. This objective will take the form of an independent research proposal that is based upon the primary literature and includes new ideas and directions. This would serve a few purposes. First, it would provide preparation for senior thesis experience in that they need to be able to propose future experiments in current projects. Second, it would provide another source for the evaluation of their critical thinking skills.\n\nCritique conclusions presented in the primary literature.\n\nThis learning objective is designed to measure a student\u2019s ability to analyze and critique the primary literature. This is performed routinely in the advanced level courses offered by the Chemistry Department.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe Chemistry Department\u2019s assessment of a student\u2019s capstone experience involves three major components: research efforts, oral presentation skills and the written thesis. We seek to help students develop and demonstrate the following behaviors and skills.\nChemistry Research Grades\nSenior research grades encompass several different components, including research efforts, the quality of the senior thesis, and student participation in senior seminar. The text below conveys our expectations for the research experience:\nResearch\nA 4.0 student will:\n\ndemonstrate independent intellectual involvement in their project.\nshow evidence of productivity that is commensurate with the amount of credit assigned to 36x.\nmake creative contributions to the design and analysis of experiments.\npropose independent ideas to overcome research obstacles.\nproactively use the primary literature as an integral resource.\ninterpret their own data and develop ideas for subsequent studies.\nmaintain a clear and complete laboratory notebook.\ndisplay critical thinking in lab meetings.\nwork to maximize research progress during the year.\n\nThesis\nA 4.0 student will:\n\nclearly describe the context of the project in the greater literature.\nbriefly summarize the history or related studies.\nexplain the novelty of the work described in the thesis.\ndetail experimental methodologies to the level of detail with which one could reproduce all experiments.\nidentify the strengths and limitations of each technique used.\nsummarize and interpret all results.\nanalyze the outcome of their experiments in the context of the greater literature, with particular emphasis on continued progress of the research project.\nclearly display experimental data through the use of tables and figures, when appropriate.\nfully and consistently cite literature precedence.\n\nSeminar\nA 4.0 student will:\n\nclearly construct and deliver an oral and poster presentation in which the relevance, novelty and preliminary results are communicated clearly within the given constraints.\ndemonstrate the progress of their project between the oral and poster presentations.\nanswer post presentation questions completely.\nbe an active participant in other presentations (by both students and outside speakers) by asking questions.\n\nGrades for each student are assigned by the student\u2019s research supervisor using the criteria described above. Student theses, presentations and experimental efforts are all discussed at a meeting of the chemistry faculty at the end of each academic year.\nAn additional level of assessment is used for each student for internal purposes. The department scores each student in the following categories; oral presentations, intellectual contributions, command of the literature, experimental skills, and written work. These \u201cscores\u201d for each student are either \u201cfails to meet expectations\u201d, \u201cmeets expectations\u201d, or \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d. These data are tracked from year to year and allow the department to observe and emerging trends and challenges and to adapt our program to foster success in our students.\nRequirements for Honors\nAll students who participate in Senior Research (CHEM H36x) for two semesters (or for one semester with an appropriate summer research experience) will be considered for departmental honors. Successful honors candidates will be expected to do superior work in major courses and to complete a research project at a level superior both in quality and quantity of effort to that expected in normal course work.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\ntwo semesters of introductory chemistry with lab (CHEM\u00a0H111\u00a0or\u00a0CHEM\u00a0H113\u00a0or\u00a0CHEM\u00a0H115, and CHEM\u00a0H104 or\u00a0CHEM\u00a0H112 or\u00a0CHEM\u00a0H114).\u00a0\ntwo semesters of organic chemistry with lab (CHEM\u00a0H222, and CHEM\u00a0H225).\none semester of physical chemistry: CHEM\u00a0H304 or CHEM\u00a0H305.\none additional full credit or two half-credit advanced chemistry courses numbered between CHEM\u00a0H301 and CHEM\u00a0H369.\n\nStudents may substitute similar courses taken at Bryn Mawr College or elsewhere but must take at least three of the course credits for the chemistry minor at Haverford College.

By reading, considering, and discussing the texts on the list, Classics students\u2014whatever the focus of their particular major\u2014will emerge with a stronger common basis for discussion and with a better sense of the range and depth of the Classical heritage. For most works a particular translation or translations is suggested on the department website, but if students would like to read a different version, they may consult with any faculty member to learn whether the translation is a reasonable alternative. (The list is posted on the departmental website at https:\/\/www.haverford.edu\/classics\/reading-list.)\nSenior Project\nThe senior experience in the Department of Classics builds towards the writing of a senior thesis (typically 35 to 45 pages) on a topic of the student\u2019s choice, under the guidance of two faculty members. In their theses, Classics students present original work based on serious and extensive research, extending knowledge about antiquity and its reception in innovative and illuminating ways.\nSenior Seminar, a weekly course conducted during the fall semester, provides a forum in which students are introduced to a variety of theoretical approaches, further develop the ability to read and critique scholarship, and learn about resources for research in the field; it also gives them an opportunity to craft an interesting and appropriate question that they will explore in the thesis they write during the spring semester.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nIn the process of writing the senior thesis, students should acquire and demonstrate:\n\nthe ability to craft an interesting and appropriate question in order to make a new contribution to the field of Classics.\nthe ability to read relevant ancient texts, in the original languages as appropriate, and to discuss and analyze aspects of Classical culture.\na familiarity with relevant modern scholarship and engagement with the methods and standards of the discipline of Classics.\nthe ability to develop an article-length paper, consisting of original work, under the mentorship of two faculty.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe thesis is evaluated on the following criteria:\n\nConceptualization of an original research question\n\tStudents strive to acknowledge and explore the full implications of an innovative thesis question.

Core requirements are two 100-level courses distributed between the ancient Near East and Egypt (either ARCH\u00a0B101 or ARCH\u00a0B104) and ancient Greece and Rome (ARCH\u00a0B102), and two semesters of the senior conference (ARCH\u00a0B398\u00a0and ARCH\u00a0B399). At least two upper-level courses should be distributed between Classical and Near Eastern subjects. Additional requirements are determined in consultation with the major advisor. Additional coursework in allied subjects may be presented for major credit but must be approved in writing by the major advisor; such courses are offered in the Departments of Anthropology, Geology, Greek, Latin and Classical Studies, Growth and Structure of Cities, and History of Art. In consultation with the major advisor, one course taken in study abroad may be accepted for credit in the major after review of the syllabus, work submitted for a grade, and a transcript. Credit will not be given for a course that is ordinarily offered by the department. Students can also take courses at the University of Pennsylvania in consultation with the major advisor.\nThe writing requirement for the major consists of two one-semester Writing Attentive courses offered within the department.\nEach student\u2019s course of study to meet major requirements will be determined in consultation with the undergraduate major advisor in the spring semester of the sophomore year, at which time a written plan will be designed.

In the fall semester, as they near completion of COML 398, students produce a viable prospectus in the form of an essay with bibliography. During the spring semester, students enrolled in the Senior Seminar (COMLL 399) complete a senior thesis of 35-40 pages, under the joint guidance of one of the instructors in COML 399 and a faculty member with expertise in the topic of the thesis.\nThe thesis should build on languages, literary and cultural interests, and competencies cultivated in coursework at Bryn Mawr and Haverford or abroad, should be broadly comparative in nature, and should normally deal with works in both of the student\u2019s major languages.\u00a0 Possible models include: a study of a critical issue as exemplified in authors or works from two different literary or linguistic traditions; an exploration of transnational issues in different media; a critical examination of a problem in literary or cultural theory or literary history; a critical examination of different translations of a literary work.\nAt the end of the spring semester, during the senior exams period, all seniors are required to participate in senior oral exams before a panel of three faculty examiners\u2014the two thesis co-advisors plus a member of the Comparative Literature Steering Committee or other relevant faculty member.

Oral, poster and written presentations are required. This experience can include original work, but it must demonstrate deep thinking and an original exposition of an advanced topic.\nStudents are required to enroll in a one-credit senior seminar course in the Fall term to ensure that they successfully complete this graduation requirement. There is a series of class activities and deadlines to help keep students on track for completing their thesis. In the fall semester, these include: the advisor selection process; submitting the topic proposal; completing the literature review; and the public poster presentation. In the optional spring semester, these include: implementing their project proposed in the previous term; completing a rough draft of their thesis; rehearsing their oral presentations; submitting the final thesis document; and giving their oral presentation. A second reader provides feedback periodically to the student and their advisor as to whether progress is satisfactory.\nA detailed schedule is provided to all students in the seminar at the beginning of the year.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe thesis work culminates in the writing and oral presentation of a paper. The student must also demonstrate the research skills required to produce this paper, in accordance with departmental deadlines.\nAn undergraduate senior paper may or may not include original research, but must present an in-depth exploration of a topic in computer science (with particular focus on understanding and evaluating some element of the computer science literature). The paper should demonstrate the student\u2019s ability to apply, in a new context, the fundamental themes and objectives that connect all computer science classes, such as:\n\nseparating a problem definition from its solution.\ndescribing clearly a proposed solution (typically with examples).\nunderstanding the correctness and applicability of a proposed solution.\ncomparing several proposed solutions in terms of clarity, resource requirements, etc.\n\nIt is common for the thesis to center on a particular algorithm or computing system, and present the correctness and\/or computational complexity thereof. However, this is not required. Students have successfully pursued other topics, such as human-computer interaction. The one core requirement is that the student demonstrates the ability to think deeply and communicate clearly about a computer science topic beyond the depth covered in classes.\nThe written thesis often resembles a review article, which explores in depth a collection of primary source articles from a single research group, or a survey article, which compares primary source articles from different origins.\nThe oral presentation is given after the thesis has been completed, though preliminary presentations are often also given as practice (and for formative assessment) during the year. The presentation is not graded, although all students are required to give one.\nThe learning goals for the research that goes into the thesis experience are as follows:\nAspirational (for the best students):\nA substantial written contribution that demonstrates original thinking and\/or insight about a research area inside computer science, under the supervision of a faculty member. This should include a full literature review, appropriate replication of existing work, and either:\n\na clear hypothesis (model), validation (proof\/experiments), and analysis;\u00a0 or\noriginal expository work, including the extension of a proof, or a new proof of an existing theorem.\nSince such theses include original material, they may constitute part of a publication (typically a joint publication with the advisor). However, publication is not required.\n\nAchievable (for most students):\nA confirmation and reiteration of existing work with an incremental contribution. Specifically, this includes a full literature review and either:\n\na good and complete confirmation of an existing experiment on new data, including a good analysis; or\nan exposition of non-trivial graduate-level published work, including an existing proof or deep explanation of its extension\/applicability (or its lack of extension) to other related concepts.\n\nRequired (of all students):\nA non-trivial literature review\/exposition of existing graduate-level published work, specifically:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe introductory material must be:\n\nreadable by someone who has understood only the core computer science undergraduate material (e.g., programming languages, hardware, theory, algorithms, and at least one intensive systems course such as compilers or operating systems).\ndetailed enough to be clear to someone within the field.\n\nThe discussion of related work should:\n\ninclude all the important related\/foundational work.\nclearly identify what problem is being addressed by each work (possibly one statement of this for many\/all the works).\nclearly state the basic approach being taken.\nexplain how each paper supports\/evaluates its own results (proof\/empirical-study\/ad-hoc argument).\nmake clear how this work relates to the thesis itself.\nin at least one case, really address the details of how the approach works (possibly several such discussions will be needed to address the point above).\n\nSenior Thesis Assessment\nThe grade is approximately 75% based on the work done under the supervision of the faculty advisor and about 25% based on meeting the deadlines of and participating in the senior seminar, including the fall poster and spring presentation.\nThe senior paper is primarily assessed by the student\u2019s advisor. Usually one or more other members of the department also read the paper and provide feedback for the student and advisor.\u00a0 If the student has a separate subject-matter advisor at another institution, that advisor is consulted during the grading of the paper if at all possible. All faculty involved in the thesis (and many students) are typically in attendance for the oral presentation.\nThe grade for the senior experience is assigned by the advisor, based on the quality of the student\u2019s written paper (judged in terms of illustrating mastery of the learning objectives relevant to the chosen topic), on participation in the oral presentation, and on the work habits illustrated during the year\u2019s work.\nAfter thorough discussion by the Department, a student\u2019s grade on the thesis will reflect how closely they have met the qualitative goals stated above.

In our small classes and research-heavy curriculum, they build strong relationships with students.\nMajors and minors pursue a core course of study that includes classes in introductory (100- level) and intermediate theory (300-level), and introductory statistical methods (200-level). Two semesters of calculus are also required. In addition, majors will take more advanced econometric methods (300-level).\nOur 200- and 300-level electives give students the opportunity to apply economic tools to particular topics such as labor markets, monetary policy, finance, and international trade. Not required but open to minors are our Junior Research Seminars, also developed around a specific economic topic or issue, they enable our students to develop their research skills in a small class setting with strong faculty support.

Some courses have different numbering across the campuses, in particular ECON\u00a0B253\u00a0at Bryn Mawr, which counts as a direct substitute for ECON\u00a0H203. The two economics departments plan their course schedules jointly so that they can offer the maximum variety of economics courses across the two campuses. Haverford Economics majors may not take the intermediate theory sequence (ECON\u00a0B200\u00a0and ECON\u00a0B202\u00a0) at Bryn Mawr.\nIn order to count a course toward the major or minor requirements, the student must earn a grade of 2.0 or higher. Students with strong economics backgrounds may place out of ECON\u00a0H104\/ECON\u00a0H105\/ECON\u00a0H106 through a placement test, but they will be required to take an extra elective to complete the major.\nStudents who plan to apply to graduate programs in public policy or business should take additional math courses through at least MATH\u00a0H121 (Multivariable Calculus III) and at least one computer science course. Similarly, students who are planning to apply to Ph.D. programs in economics should take mathematics through at least MATH\u00a0H215 (Linear Algebra) and MATH\u00a0H317(Analysis I). Economics majors also have the option to pursue the Concentration in Mathematical Economics, which is described under its own heading in this catalog.\nSenior Project\nThe senior thesis at Haverford College is the culmination of a four-year learning process during which students develop their scholarly interests and become independent thinkers. The year\u00adlong, two-semester Senior Research Seminar in Economics imparts skills and techniques essential to students undertaking original independent research projects. The first (fall) semester includes:\n\nworkshops on research techniques, on thesis writing skills and on data collection and management with Excel and Strata;\npresentations of working papers by visiting scholars preceded by small group critiques of each paper;\nand one-on-one work with a faculty member to develop a thesis proposal.\n\nThe course focuses on acquisition of tools to conduct original research, learning how to engage in scholarly discussions, and learning about critical analysis. By the end of the fall semester, students have developed an original research idea and written a formal proposal for the thesis which they have orally presented to a sub-section of the class. The faculty members overseeing the class must approve the proposal. Independent work under the guidance of a faculty advisor begins at the end of the first semester and continues throughout the second semester. During the second (spring) semester, students develop their thesis through extensive reading, empirical and or theoretical analysis of the research question, individual sessions with a faculty advisor, and group discussion. The final thesis is an original economic contribution to the field of knowledge in which the thesis is located. Each student demonstrates a clear mastery of the literature surrounding the research question, an understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the question, and adequate analysis and discussion of results.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nStudents will learn to:\n\ncraft a viable economics research question and design a project that will answer it.\nsummarize the economic scholarship related to this question while discovering and articulating relationships among texts and contextualizing the research question within the broader literature.\nconstruct and execute an analytic argument that culminates in well-grounded and testable hypotheses.\ncollect, manage, and analyze data to test the hypotheses.\ndevelop and articulate well-founded conclusions based on the empirical or theoretical evidence.\nwrite a professional-quality research paper that presents their work and findings.\npresent the findings of their research orally using relevant visual aids (graphs, tables, mathematical equations, for example).\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nWe provide two rubrics for assessment of the economics senior thesis, one for a theoretical thesis and one for the more common empirical thesis. The rubrics, which assess the written thesis, were tested and approved by faculty members in the spring of 2014. Currently each faculty member will assess the thesis of their advisees, providing a rating of each criterion. While the ratings will be related to the final grade that the student receives, the faculty member will have the opportunity to incorporate other facets of the students\u2019 experience to the grading process such as creativity, improvement, perseverance, etc. At the time of grading, the ratings will be submitted to the department\u2019s administrative assistant who will compile the results, using a numerical translation of the ratings (4=excellent; 3=proficient, etc.). Each fall, the department will meet and look over the ratings to determine which categories the students are more or less proficient in and where we have seen improvement or setbacks and to assess the continued relevance of the criteria. The outcome of this meeting will guide changes to the fall senior thesis curriculum and potentially to the economics major curriculum as well as changes to the rubric.\nRequirements for Honors\nThe Economics Department will grant departmental honors on the basis of outstanding academic performance and integrity in economics courses, and contribution to the intellectual life of the department.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\nECON\u00a0H104, ECON\u00a0H105 or ECON\u00a0H106\nECON\u00a0H201\nECON\u00a0H203 or ECON\u00a0H204\nECON\u00a0H300 or ECON\u00a0H302\nTwo other economics courses at the 200 and\/or 300 levels.\n\n\u00a0Haverford Economics\u00a0minors\u00a0may not take the intermediate theory sequence (ECON\u00a0B200\u00a0and\u00a0ECON\u00a0B202\u00a0) at Bryn Mawr.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nConcentration in Mathematical Economics \n\n\n"},{"major":"Education and Educational Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nWe build our courses as collaborative communities in which our students learn from scholars, their own and field experiences, and each other as they study and learn to facilitate innovative approaches to education. Students emerge from our program inspired and empowered to work towards social change and justice as engaged teachers, passionate learners, curious and committed researchers, and visionary leaders.\nWe offer two pathways for our minors, one oriented to liberal studies and one culminating in a secondary teaching credential. The Educational Studies minor addresses students interested in the study and practice of education broadly conceived. Students in this minor often pursue graduate study in education or other social sciences; plan to teach at the elementary level or in an independent school; or seek to create a knowledge base for careers in academia, leadership, policy studies, and community development.\nMinors in this pathway have significant freedom to design their curriculum and shape field experiences to fit and enlarge their interests. All minors take Critical Issues in Education, our introductory class that examines issues in U.S. education within the framework of educational transformation. Our Field Work Seminar, which brings minors together to reflect on their ongoing fieldwork using the framework of theories of change, is also required. In addition to these two required classes, minors select four education courses, one of which can be taught by faculty in other departments.\nMinors planning a career in secondary education enroll in the Secondary Teacher Certification pathway. Our program is accredited to prepare students for certification in biology, chemistry, Earth and Space Sciences, English, mathematics, physics, social studies, and world languages. Students in this minor take Critical Issues in Education, as well as five required education courses. Additional requirements include: completion of a major in the area in which they seek certification, additional course work within the major, English and math courses, and a semester of full-time teaching. Alumni\/nae of Haverford and Bryn Mawr Colleges are also eligible to pursue teacher certification through our program as post-bac students at significantly reduced tuition.\nStudents interested in pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Education and an elementary or secondary teacher certification have the option of sub-matriculating into Penn\u2019s Graduate School of Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nTo satisfy the requirements for the major in Education Studies, students take a minimum of six courses within the Education Department: an approved entry-point course, four 200-level courses, and one 300-level capstone course.

Note: ENGL\u00a0H399F and ENGL\u00a0H399B\u00a0 comprises a 1.5 credit course taken over the full senior year.\n\n\nSeven courses at the 100, 200 and 300 levels of which:\n\t\nat least two must be in literature written before 1800;\nat least two in literature written after 1800;\nat least one but no more than two courses at the 100 level, which can include WRPR\u00a0H150; two to three courses at the 200-level; and at least two courses at the 300-level.\n\n\nENGL\u00a0H298 and ENGL\u00a0H299, the two-semester Junior Seminar in English\nENGL\u00a0H298J, the .5 credit yearlong Junior Seminar tutorial\nENGL\u00a0H399F (fall) and ENGL\u00a0H399B (spring) for a total 1.5 credit Senior Conference\n\nNote: The department will give major credit for one semester course in a foreign literature in the original language or for Comparative Literature 200. No more than four major credits will be awarded for work done beyond the Tri- College Consortium, whether abroad or in the U.S. Courses taken in the Bryn Mawr English Department, the Swarthmore English Department, and the U. Penn English Department may also be counted towards the major at Haverford.\nSenior Project\nOverview\nThe culminating research experience for our majors is Senior Seminar, ENGL H399. The course carries 1.5 credits and involves two parts: a critical essay based on independent research and reading guided by a faculty mentor; and a comprehensive oral examination that covers the thesis and the coursework the student has done towards the major. Creative Writing concentrators produce, instead of the critical essay, a portfolio of poems or short stories, a novella, or a screenplay accompanied by a foreword or afterword that reflects on their artistic choices and offers an analytic framework within which the work may be understood.\nPreparatory Work\nEnglish majors take Junior Seminar, a year-long course that considers both major works in the field and critical and theoretical materials in the discipline. This methodological focus, along with an oral exam at the end of the first semester and comprehensive assessment at the end of the second, prepares students for the extended research and oral expectations of Senior Conference. More information on Junior Seminar is available on the department\u2019s website. Students also participate in a workshop conducted by the Writing Program during the spring preceding the senior year: this meeting encourages junior majors to draw upon the coursework they have already undertaken both to identify areas, topics, authors, and critical questions and to begin reading widely in preparation for their thesis.\nSenior Conference\nFall Semester Senior Year:\nStudents in the Senior Conference propose research topics to faculty consultants and are assigned to a faculty advisor by the middle of the fall semester. Students mark out an area of interest focused on an author, text, genre, theme, or formal feature, familiarize themselves with the major critical voices and debates pertaining to this field, and identify a set of issues that they investigate and analyze in their essays. Students meet each week in groups before moving to individualized meetings with their thesis advisor.\n\nCalendar\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\nSeptember\nsubmission of essay topic and preferences for faculty consultant\n\nOctober\ndescription of project, approved by assigned faculty consultant\n\nOctober\nmeeting with Reference Librarian\n\nNovember\ntwo-page thesis statement due with short bibliography of relevant primary and critical sources\n\nDecember\ndetailed annotated bibliography\n\n\n\nSpring Semester Senior Year:\nStudents have individual tutorials as they work towards submission of a draft and final thesis. At the end of the spring semester, eight students give presentations of their work over the course of two evenings.

Theses will be based on insightful close readings and deep engagement with relevant critical and background material. The creative thesis option is assayed for the imagination with which particular projects are conceived, control over the medium, inventive play with generic conventions, insight, clarity and beauty of expression, and the capacity for self-reflection as demonstrated in the critical foreword\/afterword.\nStudents are assessed at various stages of the process, described below, both by individual advisors and department faculty as a whole. Final letter grades are decided upon by the full department in careful discussion and consideration of student performance at each stage. Students receive extensive written comments from first reader (faculty mentor) and second reader at the end of the process.\nThe faculty mentor provides feedback on the following elements prior to the student examination:\n\nPreliminary proposal\n4-5 pages of preliminary draft\nFull draft\nAnnotated bibliography\n\nThe faculty mentor and department assess the following dimensions of the project as a full group:\n\nQuality of Senior Essay\nQuality of Oral Examination\nStudent Reflective Statement\n\nRequirements for Honors\nThe department awards honors in English on the basis of performance in coursework within the Tri-College departments, the senior essay and the oral examination conducted at the end of the senior year. The department reserves honors and high honors for distinguished achievement in all three of these areas.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nCreative Writing Concentration \n\n\n"},{"major":"Environmental Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nThe Bi-Co ES major combines the strengths of our two liberal arts campuses to create an interdisciplinary program that teaches students to synthesize diverse disciplinary knowledge and approaches, and to communicate effectively across disciplinary boundaries as they engage with environmental issues. In addressing these issues, ES students will apply critical thinking and analytical skills within a holistic, systems framework that includes social justice as an essential component.\nHaverford, Bryn Mawr, and Swarthmore also offer an interdisciplinary Tri-Co ES minor, involving departments and faculty on all three campuses from the natural sciences, engineering, mathematics, the social sciences, the humanities, and the arts. The Tri-Co ES minor brings together students and faculty to explore interactions among earth systems, human societies, and local and global environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nStudents are required to take a minimum of 11 courses in the Environmental Studies major.\nI. Core courses (6 credits)\nSix required courses are in the core program, which consists of:\n\nENVS\u00a0H101 or ENVS\u00a0B101\u00a0or ENVS S001: Case Studies in Environmental Issues\nENVS\u00a0H201\u00a0or ENVS\u00a0B201: Laboratory in Environmental Sciences\nENVS\u00a0H202\u00a0or\u00a0ENVS\u00a0B202: Environment and Society\nENVS\u00a0H203\u00a0or\u00a0ENVS\u00a0B203: Environmental Humanities\nENVS\u00a0H204\u00a0or ENVS\u00a0B204: Environmental Studies Praxis\nENVS\u00a0H397 or ENVS\u00a0B397 or ENVS S091: Environmental Studies Senior Capstone (during the fall or spring semester of the senior year)\n\nStudents interested in pursuing an ENVS major are strongly encouraged to take ENVS 101 during their first year of study.\u00a0\nENVS 101 and 397 are each offered two times per year: once at Haverford and once at Bryn Mawr, frequently in alternate semesters. Students are welcome to take these courses on either campus.\nII. Electives and focus area (5 credits)\nIn addition to the core courses, ENVS majors must complete five electives. A wide variety of environmentally themed courses may serve as ENVS electives, including many courses offered by other departments and programs. Each student's set of elective courses must fulfill the following requirements:\n\nA minimum of one course must come from each of two broad divisional groups:\n\t\nNatural sciences, mathematics, and engineering;\nSocial sciences, humanities, and arts.\n\n\nAt least two elective courses must be taken at the 300-level or equivalent.\nAt least three elective courses must articulate a coherent intellectual or thematic focus (a \u201cfocus area\u201d) that students develop in consultation with their\u00a0ENVS\u00a0advisor;\n\nIII. Focus area\nThe possibilities of a focus area are many. A student\u2019s focus area may be organized by a specific perspective on the study of the environment, a particular interdisciplinary focus, or even a geographic region. Focus areas are designated in consultation with an ENVS advisor. Early planning for the ENVS major allows students to begin satisfying prerequisites for advanced focus area courses.\nSample focus area topics include, but are not limited to: Environment and Society, Environmental Policy, Earth Systems, Environmental Modeling, Environmental Art and Technology, and Environment in East Asia.\nCourses taken as ENVS\u00a0major electives need not be prefixed with \u201cENVS\u201d in the course catalog. Advanced courses with appropriate thematic content offered by any program, from Africana Studies, through Mathematics, to Visual Studies, may be counted.\u00a0\nUpon declaration of the ENVS major, the coursework plan must be approved by a major advisor on the student's home campus. Courses approved for the Environmental Studies major at Swarthmore can be taken for the Bi-Co ENVS\u00a0major or substituted for requirements contingent upon the major advisor\u2019s approval.\nCourses taken while studying abroad or off-campus may be approved for the ENVS\u00a0major by the major advisor in consultation with the Bi-Co ENVS\u00a0Department faculty.\nSenior Project\nStudents majoring in Environmental Studies will pursue their capstone experience in any one of a number of ways, centered within the one-semester ENVS\u00a0H397\u00a0or ENVS\u00a0B397\u00a0course. In this course, students will design and complete a project under the supervision of a faculty member that builds upon methods learned in the ENVS 200-level sequence and elaborated on during the Focus Area. In most cases, ENVS 397 will involve collaborating with one or more outside organizations or groups, and senior projects will be an individual project designed in concert with the faculty member and these organizations. For example, senior projects could include, but are not limited to, digital mapping and annotation of green space, the design and implementation of an environmental education curricular module, or an environmental art project. Students are strongly encouraged to consider possible senior project topics or techniques they would like to use prior to their senior year, and to be in dialogue with their faculty advisors about possible senior projects during the third year of study.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\n\nCollaboration with others, including students, faculty and staff, and outside partners\n\tEach senior is expected to hone the skills required to collaborate in an effective fashion throughout the course of the senior project. These skills are likely to include working effectively outside of the campus space.\u00a0\nApplication of techniques and methods acquired during the major sequence\n\tThe senior project is an opportunity for each student to demonstrate and apply the skills that are acquired during the ENVS\u00a0major sequence, from research skills to communication skills. Students are expected to bring their unique strengths, approaches, and prior coursework to bear on the senior project.\nIndependent knowledge and responsibility\n\tEach senior is responsible for their share of the project, even if it is part of a larger, team-based, collaborative effort. Students will demonstrate responsibility in the design and implementation of the project, in conversation with the faculty advisor and outside voices. Careful planning and consistent work effort are essential to completing a senior project.\nEthical practices for campus and community-oriented work\n\tStudents will build upon the knowledge acquired during the ENVS 200-level sequence to collaborate with on- and off-campus partners in an ethical and responsible way. This includes practicing ethical scholarship, sharing work effectively, and collaborating.\u00a0\nCreativity in approaches to major questions\n\tStudents will address the central topic of their senior project in creative and original ways. This should include some element of creative risk or ambition, which is encouraged and supervised by the ENVS\u00a0faculty.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nAt the conclusion of a Senior Project, students will be expected to present their final project in an oral form to their peers and faculty from the ENVS\u00a0department. In addition, each student will also be expected to submit a written form of the final project that documents their project and reflects on the experience. The faculty member supervising ENVS H397 will evaluate student work based on the quality and effort brought to bear during the project, and will assign a final numerical grade for the Senior Project. This faculty member may consult with other members of the ENVS\u00a0department to provide feedback to individual students prior to Commencement.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nThe Tri-Co ENVS\u00a0minor consists of six courses, including an introductory course. Students may complete the introductory course at any of the three campuses. The six required courses are:\n\nA required introductory course to be taken prior to the senior year. This may be ENVS\u00a0H101 at Haverford or ENVS\u00a0B101 at Bryn Mawr or the parallel course at Swarthmore (ENVS S001). Any one of these courses satisfies the requirement, and students may take no more than one such course for credit toward the minor.\nFour elective course credits from approved lists of core and cognate courses, including two credits in each of the following two categories. Students may use no more than one cognate course credit for each category. (See the ENVS\u00a0website for course lists and more about core and cognate courses.) No more than one of these four course credits may be in the student\u2019s major.\n\t\nEnvironmental Science, Engineering, and Math: courses that build understanding and knowledge of scientific methods and theories, and explore how these can be applied in identifying and addressing environmental challenges. At least one of the courses in this category must have a laboratory component.\nEnvironmental Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts: courses that build understanding and knowledge of social and political structures as well as ethical considerations, and how these inform our individual and collective responses to environmental challenges.\n\n\nAn advanced elective in Environmental Studies (300-level, or its equivalent at Swarthmore) that can be from either category.\n\nHaverford students interested in the ENVS\u00a0minor should plan their course schedule with the ENVS Chair in consultation with their major advisor. In choosing electives, students should aim to include mostly intermediate or advanced courses.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nHealth Studies Multidisciplinary Minor \nPeace, Justice, and Human Rights Concentration \nVisual Studies Minor \n\n\n"},{"major":"Film Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nFilm Studies is a Bryn Mawr College minor.

This two-semester, two-credit course provides students with a structured environment to develop a body of work that is presented in the form of an exhibition at the Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery. The scope of the senior thesis exhibition accomplishes the process of selecting works to be included in the exhibition, determining the layout of the works, and installing the works in the Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery. Students participate in the planning of the opening reception for their thesis exhibition, which is advertised to a broad audience. During the opening, they present their work to a general audience and are available to answer questions from guests. After the gallery opening, the Fine Arts Department faculty schedules a full departmental review of the work presented by each student. During the review each student articulates a formal presentation of their work and students are asked to respond to questions and comments put forth by the faculty.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nSeniors are expected to create a coherent body of work that demonstrates proficiency in the use of their chosen concentration, develop content and articulate ideas with a personal and effective visual language and present their work in a professionally installed gallery exhibition, e.g. in the Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery, Atrium Gallery, or Alcove Gallery. In addition to presenting visual works, majors are expected to articulate the content and context of their work in a written statement, which is on display with their work along with researches on visual art and artists that are related to their own work. These educational goals are augmented by outside speakers, visiting artists, exhibitions and non-studio courses in visual culture sponsored by the department or taught by its faculty.\nSenior Project Assessment\nEach thesis project is evaluated by the Faculty members who are also their concentration advisors using the following categories:\n\nOriginal ideas and creativity.\nProficiency in their chosen concentration.\nQuality of the project.\nActive discussion and participation during group critiques by departmental full faculty, which forms in the beginning, mid\u00adterm, and final week, and weekly group critique and research in addition to individual meetings with the faculty members.\nProgress in their project.\nResearch on related sources, e.g. professional artist works and digital presentation.\nAttendance.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\nMinors must take four 100-level foundation courses in different disciplines.\nTwo 200-level courses and one 300-level course within the student\u2019s chosen focal area within fine arts.\nOne art history\/theory\/criticism or visual culture course.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"French and Francophone Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur demanding language program embraces the full range of communication skills\u2014speaking, listening, reading, and writing\u2014in French.

The senior thesis is modeled after a Master's thesis project but is scaled down for the different time frame (one year versus two years) and educational level of a senior undergraduate student. The thesis project plan is initially developed and agreed upon through consultation between the supervising faculty member(s) and the student. This is usually done during the second semester of a students\u2019 junior year. Most of the research is conducted independently by the student. The advisor serves as a source of ideas concerning scientific literature, methodologies, and project support. The advisor may visit and inspect the research sites, laboratory or model, and offer advice on how the research should be conducted or modified.\nIf approved to undertake a senior thesis, a student will enroll in GEOL\u00a0B398\u00a0each of their final two semesters for a total of 1.0 credit (0.5 credits per semester).

Following review of submitted proposals, students or faculty members may choose or recommend, respectively, not to continue the independent thesis, in which case the student would not enroll for the second semester of GEOL\u00a0B398.\nRequirements for Honors\nHonors are awarded to students who have outstanding academic records in Geology and allied fields, have completed an independent senior thesis project, and whose research is judged by the department faculty to be of the highest quality.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nA minor in Geology consists of two 100-level Geology courses, and any four of the 200- or 300-level courses offered by the department. Two 0.5 credit courses may be combined to count toward one of the 100-level courses. Alternatively, an additional 200- or 300-level course may be substituted for one of the 100-level courses to meet the minor requirements.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConcentration Requirements\nConcentration in Geoarchaeology\n\nThe geoarchaeology concentration allows students majoring in Anthropology, Archaeology, or Geology to explore the connections among these fields with respect to how our human ancestors interacted with past environments, and how traces of human behavior are preserved in the physical environment. In Geology, the geoarchaeology concentration consists of 13 courses: GEOL\u00a0B101,GEOL\u00a0B202, GEOL\u00a0B203, GEOL\u00a0B204, GEOL\u00a0B205, GEOL\u00a0B208, GEOL\u00a0B270, and GEOL\u00a0B399; two semesters of chemistry; two semesters of math, statistics, or computational methods; either ARCH\u00a0B101 or ANTH\u00a0B101; and one 200- or 300-level elective from among current offerings in Anthropology or Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology. Paperwork for the concentration should be filed at the same time as the major work plan. For course planning advice, consult with Don Barber (Geology), Casey Barrier (Anthropology) or Peter Magee (Archaeology).\nConcentration in Geochemistry\nThe geochemistry concentration encourages students majoring either in Geology or in Chemistry to design a course of study that emphasizes Earth chemistry. Paperwork for the concentration should be filed at the same time as the major work plan. For a Geology major with a concentration in geochemistry, the following are required: GEOL\u00a0B101, GEOL\u00a0B202GEOL\u00a0B203, GEOL\u00a0B204, GEOL\u00a0B205, GEOL\u00a0B208, and GEOL\u00a0B399; CHEM\u00a0B103 (General Chemistry) and CHEM\u00a0B104 (General Chemistry II); CHEM\u00a0B211(Organic Chemistry) or CHEM\u00a0B231 (Inorganic Chemistry); GEOL\u00a0B302 (Low Temperature Geochemistry) or GEOL\u00a0B305 (Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology) or GEOL\u00a0B350 (requires major advisor approval); one additional 300-level geochemistry-themed GEOL course or one additional advanced CHEM course. For a Chemistry major with a concentration in geochemistry, the following are required in addition to Chemistry major requirements (see Chemistry major advisor): GEOL\u00a0B101 (How the Earth Works), GEOL\u00a0B202 (Mineralogy\/Crystal Chemistry), two additional 300-level geochemistry-themed GEOL courses including GEOL\u00a0B302 (Low Temperature Geochemistry) or GEOL\u00a0B305 (Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology) or GEOL\u00a0B350 (requires Geology major advisor approval). For course planning advice, contact Pedro Marenco (Geology) or Sharon Burgmayer (Chemistry).\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"German and German Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nCourse offerings serve students with particular interests in German literature, literary theory and criticism as well as those interested in studying German and German-speaking cultures from the perspective of communication arts, film, history, history of ideas, history of art and architecture, history of religion, institutions, linguistics, mass media, philosophy, politics, urban anthropology, and folklore. Majors choose between a literature concentration or a German studies concentration, and thorough knowledge of German is a common goal for both. The objective of our language instruction is to teach students communicative skills that would enable them to function effectively in authentic conditions of language use, and to speak and write in idiomatic German. Major components of all German courses are the examination of issues that underline the cosmopolitanism as well as the specificity and complexity of contemporary German culture. We encourage many German majors to take courses in interdisciplinary areas, such as comparative literature, history, political science, philosophy, music, and feminist and gender studies, where they read works of criticism in these areas in the original German.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nThe Department of German and German Studies offers a major and a minor. A German major consists of 10 credits. After completing GERM\u00a0H002 (or its equivalent), the German major normally requires:\n\n\n\ntwo intermediate German courses (GERM\u00a0H101 and GERM\u00a0H102);\n\n\n\nseven courses at the 200 and 300 level\n\n\neither one semester of Senior Conference (GERM\u00a0H399) for majors opting to write a German senior thesis or an additional 300 level seminar in German for double majors writing a senior essay instead of a senior thesis.\n\n\n\nStudents who place out of 101 and 102 and begin their studies at the 200 level are still required to take 10 credits to fulfill the major requirements. Two of the seven courses at the 200 or 300 level could be non-German credit in the broader area of German Studies with the approval of the department.\nThe Department of German and German Studies offers writing attentive and writing intensive courses. Majors are required to take two writing attentive courses to help them develop critical writing skills and the ability to analyze literary texts in their historical and cultural contexts.\nAll German majors must take at least one 200 and one 300 level course in the Bi-Co German Department. For students studying abroad for one semester, up to four courses may count toward the major. For students studying abroad for an entire academic year, up to six courses may count toward the major. Approval from the department is required for awarding credits from abroad.\nSenior Thesis Project\nA senior thesis project is required for all German majors. There are four options available to German majors and double majors to serve as meaningful capstones to their studies:\n\n\nA senior thesis (around 40 pages) in German.\n\n\nA combined thesis (40 + pages) written in English for double majors in a related discipline with a strong German Studies component. A combined thesis has to be approved by the department.\n\n\nA senior essay (20 pages) for double majors, which grows out of a research paper produced in a 300 level seminar. Students pursing this option will not take the Senior Conference and instead will take an additional 300 level seminar.\n\n\nA project, which may be either a 15-20-minute film or an exhibition with a portfolio and summary in German. The content of the project and portfolio should be equivalent to a 40-page research paper in German.\n\n\nSenior Thesis Presentation\nAt the conclusion of their senior year, all majors are expected to participate in a public presentation of their thesis projects. Minors are invited and encouraged to present on a project they have done in their upper-level German coursework.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nIn writing the senior thesis, the student should:\n\n\nconceive a theoretically informed and well-designed research project\n\n\napply the language skills to research and evaluate primary and secondary materials\n\n\nutilize the analytical and methodological skills to produce an innovative and critically astute thesis\n\n\nhone analytical and expository writing skills through all stages of composing the thesis project\n\n\nAssessment of Senior Thesis\nThe quality of the thesis is evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n\noriginality of topic\n\n\nmastery of analysis (ability to perform a critical analysis of texts or cultural phenomena)\n\n\nfamiliarity with primary and secondary literature\n\n\ncreative application of relevant theoretical discourses\n\n\nclarity of writing\n\n\nHonors\nAny student whose grade point average in the major at the end of their senior year is 3.8 or higher qualifies for departmental honors. Students who have completed a thesis and whose major grade point average at the end of the senior year is 3.6 or higher, but not 3.8, are eligible to be discussed as candidates for departmental honors. A student in this range of eligibility must be sponsored by at least one faculty member with whom she has done coursework, and at least one other faculty member must read some of the student's advanced work and agree on the excellence of the work in order for departmental honors to be awarded. If there is a sharp difference of opinion, additional readers will serve as needed.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nA minor in German and German Studies consists of six credits. To minor, students are normally required to take:\n\n\ntwo Intermediate German courses (GERM\u00a0H101 and GERM\u00a0H102)\n\n\n\nfour German courses at the 200 and 300 level\n\n\nIf students are placed at the 200 level, they must take additional German courses at and above 200 level to fulfill the 6-credit requirement.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Greek","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nWe encourage students in the major to do coursework in almost any field that they can link to their language studies.  Many of our majors have pursued their particular interests through work in English, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, Religion, Art History, Archaeology, History, and Music, though many other fields are possible.\nStudents pursuing the Greek major must be able to read Greek at an advanced level, which entails six courses in Greek beyond the elementary level.  At least four of them must be at the advanced level or above. Through discussion and critical analysis, language classes at this level  (200- and 300-level) typically address a particular theme, text, or topic related to ancient language or culture.\nThey must also take a minimum of three classes at a level above introductory in a related field. The major culminates with each student participating in the department-wide Senior Seminar and producing a Senior Thesis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nClassical Culture Track (11 Courses)\nHaverford\u2019s track in Classical Culture offers students the opportunity to explore life in Classical antiquity in all of its dimensions\u2014from language, to literature, to history, philosophy, archaeology, and more\u2014as well as its impact on later cultural traditions. It is designed to allow the student to use a foundation in Greek or Latin as the springboard to chart their own paths through the College's rich offerings in archaeology and art history, history, politics, philosophy and religion, and classical literature and its reception.\n\nTwo semesters in either Latin or Greek at any level.\nSeven elective courses, including at least two at the 200 level or above, and one at the 300 level or above. Such courses could include:\u00a0\n\t\nAny Classical Studies, Greek, or Latin course (including cross-listed and tagged courses offered by faculty in other departments)\nWith advisor approval, courses outside the department that engage with the ancient Mediterranean world or its afterlife; for example:\u00a0\n\t\t\nother historical languages\u00a0\nArchaeology, Art History, History, Religion, or Anthropology courses on Mediterranean, North African, and Near Eastern cultures\u00a0\ncourses on the reception of ancient Mediterranean culture, such as\u00a0Medieval Studies, Comparative Literature, Museum Studies, or courses\u00a0focused on the classical tradition\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSenior Seminar and Thesis (CSTS\u00a0H398\/CSTS\u00a0H399).\n\nClassical Languages Track (11 Courses)\nHaverford\u2019s Classical Languages track offers students the opportunity to gain proficiency in one of both of Greek and Latin or another classical language and to explore Classical texts and the literary, historical, and philosophical contexts in which they emerged.\n\nSix courses beyond the introductory level in Greek or Latin, of which at least four must be at the 200 level or above.\u00a0\nThree elective courses.

Many of these texts will have been assigned in different classes, while others will complement class readings. By reading, considering, and discussing the texts on the list, Classics students\u2014whatever the focus of their particular major\u2014will emerge with a stronger common basis for discussion and with a better sense of the range and depth of the Classical heritage. For most works a particular translation or translations is suggested on the department website, but if students would like to read a different version, they may consult with any faculty member to learn whether the translation is a reasonable alternative. (The list is posted on the departmental website at https:\/\/www.haverford.edu\/classics\/reading-list.)\nSenior Project\nThe senior experience in the Department of Classics builds towards the writing of a senior thesis (typically 35 to 45 pages) on a topic of the student\u2019s choice, under the guidance of two faculty members. In their theses, Classics students present original work based on serious and extensive research, extending knowledge about antiquity and its reception in innovative and illuminating ways.\nSenior Seminar, a weekly course conducted during the fall semester, provides a forum in which students are introduced to a variety of theoretical approaches, further develop the ability to read and critique scholarship, and learn about resources for research in the field; it also gives them an opportunity to craft an interesting and appropriate question that they will explore in the thesis they write during the spring semester.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nIn the process of writing the senior thesis, students should acquire and demonstrate:\n\nthe ability to craft an interesting and appropriate question in order to make a new contribution to the field of Classics.\nthe ability to read relevant ancient texts, in the original languages as appropriate, and to discuss and analyze aspects of Classical culture.\na familiarity with relevant modern scholarship and engagement with the methods and standards of the discipline of Classics.\nthe ability to develop an article-length paper, consisting of original work, under the mentorship of two faculty.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe thesis is evaluated on the following criteria:\n\nConceptualization of an original research question\n\tStudents strive to acknowledge and explore the full implications of an innovative thesis question. Students demonstrate with depth and precision the importance of the question and what is at stake in answering it.\nFamiliarity with and understanding of primary texts\n\tStudents engage primary sources to answer their research question. Their primary evidence is well organized, exhaustive, and integrated with the continuing scholarly conversation to which they are contributing. Students strive to display a creative approach to existing sources or bring new and illuminating sources to bear on their research question.\nEngagement with secondary literature\n\tStudents demonstrate comprehensive mastery of scholarly literature as it pertains to the thesis topic by synthesis of and contribution to the scholarly conversation.\nMethodological and theoretical approach\n\tStudents ground their theses in current knowledge about antiquity, demonstrating a thorough understanding of relevant methodological and theoretical issues.\nQuality of argument\n\tStudents construct a well-reasoned, well structured, and clearly expressed argument; the line of thought emerges clearly, and the conclusions are persuasive.\nClarity of writing\n\tWriting is consistently engaging, clear, well organized, and enjoyable to read.\nOral presentation\n\tAt the end of the semester, students demonstrate comprehensive understanding of their topic in an articulate and engaging presentation and are able to provide innovative and thoughtful answers to questions.\n\nRequirements for Honors\nStudents demonstrating superior performance in course work in the major and on the senior thesis will be eligible for departmental honors. To qualify for honors, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.7 in their major courses (3.85 for high honors) and earn a grade of at least 3.7 on the senior thesis (3.85 for high honors).\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nClassical Culture Track (6 Courses)\n\nSix courses drawn from the range of courses counted towards the Classical Culture Major, including:\u00a0\n\t\nAt least two Classical Culture and Society courses at the 200 level or above\nAt least two Greek or Latin courses at any level\u00a0\n\n\n\nClassical Languages Track (6 Courses)\n\nSix courses in Greek or Latin, including at least two at the 200 level or above.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Growth and Structure of Cities","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nCore introductory classes present analytic approaches that explore issues of changing forms of the city over time and explore the variety of ways through which women and men have re-created global urban life across history and across cultures.\nWith these foundations, students pursue their interests through classes in architecture, urban social and economic relations, urban history, studies of planning and the environmental conditions of urban life.\nOpportunities for internships, volunteering, and study abroad also enrich the major. Advanced seminars further ground the course of study by focusing on specific cities and topics.\nComplementing the major, students may also choose to do a minor or a second major that allows them to complement their work in Cities with more specialized knowledge, whether in environmental studies, economics, or studies of language and culture. Students also may apply for the 3+2 Program in City and Regional Planning in their junior year, offered in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nA minimum of 15 courses (11 courses in Cities and four allied courses in other related fields) is required to complete the major. Two introductory courses (CITY\u00a0B185, CITY\u00a0B190) balance sociocultural and formal approaches to urban form and the built environment, and introduce cross-cultural and historical comparison of urban development. The introductory sequence should be completed with a broader architectural survey course (CITY\u00a0B253, CITY\u00a0B254, CITY\u00a0B255) and a second social science course that entails extended analysis and writing (CITY\u00a0B229). These courses should be completed as early as possible in the first and second years; at least two of them must be taken by the end of the first semester of the sophomore year.\nWriting across multiple disciplines is central to the major, drawing on sources as varied as architectural and visual materials, ethnographic fieldwork, archival and textual study, theoretical reflection and policy engagement. Students write and receive commentary on their arguments and expression from their introductory classes through their required capstone thesis. While most courses in the major have important writing components, at the moment CITY\u00a0B229 acts as our primary writing-intensive course, asking students to draw upon the breadth of their interests to focus on researching, writing and rewriting within a comparative framework. In Fall 2018, we will explore other dimensions of writing in the humanities with CITY\u00a0B377: Writing Architecture. At the same time, students are encouraged to use other classes within the major to develop a range of skills in methods, theory, presentations, oral and written.\nAfter these introductory courses, each student selects six elective courses within the Cities Department, including cross-listed courses.\u00a0At least two classes must be at the 300 level in Cities or cross-listed courses. A strong foundation in our varied methods is also intrinsic to the Cities major. In the introductory classes, students will be exposed to architectural and spatial analyses, qualitative and quantitative methods, and comparative case studies, based in an awareness of local and global histories. More specialized methods classes include CITY\u00a0B217 (Social Science Methods), CITY\u00a0B201 (GIS) and our architectural studio sequence (CITY\u00a0B226\/CITY\u00a0B228), which allows students to make informed choices about careers in architecture and design. The use of appropriate methods is honed in the senior thesis.\nIn the senior year, a capstone course is required of all majors. Most students join together in a research seminar, CITY\u00a0B398, in the fall of that year, writing a 40-60 page thesis on a topic of their choice, based on primary documents and original research and\/or design. Occasionally, however, after consultation with the major advisors, the student may elect another 300-level course or a program for independent research. This is often the case with double majors who write a thesis in another field.\u00a0\nFinally, each student must also identify four courses outside Cities that represent expertise to complement her work in the major. These may include courses such as physics and calculus for architects, additional courses in economics, political science, sociology, or anthropology for students more focused on the social sciences and planning, or courses that build on language, design, or regional interests. Any minor, concentration, or second major fulfills this requirement. Cities courses that are cross-listed with other departments or originate in them can be counted only once in the course selection, although they may be either allied or elective courses.\nBoth the Cities Department electives and the four or more allied courses must be chosen in close consultation with the major advisors in order to create a strongly coherent sequence and focus. This is especially true for students interested in architectural design, who will need to arrange studio courses (CITY\u00a0B226, CITY\u00a0B228) as well as accompanying courses in math, science and architectural history; they should contact the department chair or Daniela Voith in their first year.\u00a0Students interested in a second major should consult with advisors early on.\nStudents should also note that many courses in the department beyond the introductory sequence are not given every year; this is true as well with regard to cross-listed courses. Students should also note that courses may carry prerequisites in cities, art history, economics, history, sociology, or the natural sciences and have limited enrollments because of space and technology (Architecture Studio, GIS).\nCities students should test their knowledge through engagement with cities worldwide beyond the classroom. Hence programs for study abroad or off campus are encouraged, within the limits of the Bryn Mawr and Haverford rules and practices. In general, a one-semester program is strongly preferred. The Cities Department regularly works with off-campus and study-abroad programs that are strong in architectural history, planning, and design, as well as those that allow students to pursue social and cultural interests and hone language skills. Students who would like to spend part or all of their junior year away must consult with the major advisors and appropriate deans early in their sophomore year. Internships are also an important component of the program either in the summer or for credit with faculty supervision.\nOver nearly five decades, Cities students have created major plans that have allowed them to develop their interests in cities with an eye toward future engagement with architecture, planning, ethnography, history, law, environmental studies, mass media, public health, the fine arts, and other fields. No matter the focus, though, each Cities student develops solid foundations in both the history of architectural and urban form and the analysis of urban culture, societies, and policy. Careful methodological choices, clear analytical writing, and critical visual readings constitute the hallmarks of the major. Strong interactions with faculty and other students and alums that will continue even after graduation also characterizes the department as a growing and creative social cohort beyond Bryn Mawr and Haverford as well.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nStudents who wish to minor in the Cities Department must take at least two out of the four required courses and four cities electives, including two at the 300 level. Senior Seminar is not mandatory for fulfilling the cities minor.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Health Studies","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur growing menu of courses follows three tracks: mechanisms of disease and maintenance of health (often biology and psychology courses); cultural, literary, and visual representations of health and illness (often anthropology and literature courses); and responses of social, civic, and governmental structure to issues of health and disease (often anthropology, history, and social work courses). Minors must complete one class from each track.\nWe also require minors to take an introductory level course and a senior-level capstone course, both of which bring a range of perspectives to bear on a series of specific health-related issues.  Our capstone course culminates with students examining a single health issue from their own disciplinary perspective and delineating new directions for research. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nThe Bi-Co Health Studies minor consists of six courses, which include:\u00a0\n\nA required introductory course (HLTH\u00a0B115\/HLTH\u00a0H115), offered in the fall and spring semesters, should be completed during the first or second year, however, juniors and seniors are not prohibited from enrolling in the course if they develop an interest in the minor; successful completion of the introductory course is a pre-requisite for enrolling in the Senior Seminar (HLTH\u00a0H398).\n\t\u00a0\nThree elective core course credits from a list approved by the faculty steering committee. Students must elect two of these courses from a department outside of the student\u2019s major, and at least two of these courses should be at the non-introductory level. Students must take one core course in each of three tracks:\u00a0\n\nM track: mechanisms of disease and the maintenance of the healthy body\u00a0\nR track: cultural, literary, visual and ethical representations of health and illness\u00a0\nS track:\u00a0familial, social, civic and governmental systems that structure and respond to issues of health and disease.\u00a0\n\n\nOne additional course, outside the student\u2019s major. Students are encouraged to choose an additional core course from one of the three tracks, but may also select one from a list of approved affiliate courses that deal with health issues, but not necessarily as their primary focus.\u00a0In order for an affiliate course to count toward the minor, the student is expected to pursue a health-related topic for the final paper or project for the course.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nA senior seminar organized around a single theme, which varies each year. Potential themes could be a particular health intervention, a category of diseases, a specific population, or an important social determinant of health, among others. Students complete two projects that address the theme: one that is grounded in their own disciplinary perspective and one that requires collaboration with fellow students majoring in other disciplines. The senior seminar is offered twice each year, once in the fall and once in the spring, on different themes.\n\nNo more than two of the six minor credits may come from institutions outside the Tri-Co. Only one course that fulfills a student\u2019s graduation requirement for their major can also fulfill a requirement for the Health Studies minor. For students who are concentrating or minoring in an additional program, only one of the four elective courses for Health Studies can also fulfill a requirement for the concentration or second minor.\u00a0\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"History","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur program puts a strong emphasis on engagement with primary sources and other historical evidence, and equips students with the tools to analyze and interpret them. Our classes stress, and our accomplished faculty model, imaginative analysis rooted in fact.\nBreadth and depth characterize our course of study.  Majors develop a familiarity with the broad outlines of history, the range of interpretations advanced by historians, and the debates connected to the writing of history, while also cultivating an interest in\u2014and undertaking a focused study of\u2014a particular topic.\nStudents typically begin the major by completing two semesters of introductory (100-level) coursework. While courses at this level cover a range of regions, periods, and areas of study, all train students to be discerning readers of primary texts and to build persuasive arguments.\nMajors then move on to 200- and 300-level courses. We require majors to select courses that span three fields. These three fields are chosen from the six defined fields (U.S., Early European, Modern European, Latin American, East Asian, and History of Science and Medicine) that we offer. Majors can also design a field to reflect their own interests. Our 200-level classes and 300-level seminars typically cover a broad range of sources and analytical approaches and emphasize research skills. As seniors, majors investigate a specific historical question and produce a Senior Thesis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nTo complete the history major, students must\u00a0 take eleven courses distributed across the history\u00a0 curriculum.\nStudents take any 100-level course, which introduces both historical materials and the skills we expect in the major.\nThey then take five 200-level courses as well as three\u00a0 300-level seminars. Students should take at least two\u00a0 of their 300-level seminars by the end of their junior year. Students select courses from different fields\u00a0 of concentration, e.g., European history, U.S. history,\u00a0 East Asian history, Latin American history, history of\u00a0 science and medicine. Students can also design a field\u00a0 based on courses offered at Haverford, Bryn Mawr,\u00a0 and Swarthmore. Students who study overseas often\u00a0 take advantage of courses abroad to enrich their major.\u00a0All majors must complete three geographic,\u00a0 temporal or thematic fields by taking two courses\u00a0 (above the 100 level) within a field to complete that\u00a0 field requirement.\nOver the course of their senior year, all history\u00a0 majors write a year-long, i.e., two-semester, senior\u00a0 thesis, as described below. During the fall they\u00a0 complete their research in the thesis seminar. In\u00a0 the spring they work one-on-one with their faculty\u00a0 advisors to write and revise their theses.\u00a0\nSenior Thesis\nThe senior thesis in the Department of History is\u00a0 a year-long, two-credit research project on a topic\u00a0 the student chooses to investigate. In completing a\u00a0 thesis, history students conduct original research\u00a0 and craft an extended argument. The senior thesis\u00a0 project occurs in three steps.\u00a0\nPreliminary Work\nIn the spring semester of their junior year, history majors work with faculty mentors to compose an initial thesis proposal that articulates a specific research question. In light of faculty feedback, students often spend the summer before their senior year doing initial archival research and mastering the relevant historical literature.\nResearch and Analysis\nIn the fall semester of their senior year, students enroll in HIST\u00a0H400A, a weekly seminar that gives students an opportunity to identify, survey, and analyze the sources they will use in their thesis and to review the relevant scholarship. In this seminar students complete a series of assignments that help them conceptualize, research, and begin drafting their thesis. Assignments include: a revised thesis proposal, analysis of a primary source related to their thesis, critical review of the scholarly literature relevant to their topic, and a thesis prospectus that defines their thesis topic, describes their evidence, and outlines their argument.\nWriting\nIn the spring semester students enroll in HIST\u00a0H400B, a supervised research and writing seminar that builds on the work they completed in fall semester. Working under the guidance of faculty advisors, students draft and revise their theses, submitting sections throughout the semester. Once they have drafted the different sections, they revise the entire thesis and submit a polished final draft. A history thesis is typically around 60 pages. After handing in the final version, students present their theses in an oral defense to their faculty advisors.\nSenior Thesis Learning Goals\nAs a capstone experience, the senior thesis in history hopes to achieve complementary goals:\nResearch\n\nConceptualize a research question.\nMake a historical argument.\nIdentify and master relevant scholarship.\nLocate and analyze primary source materials.\n\nWriting\n\nDevelop a cogent argument.\nUse evidence to support the argument\nWrite clearly and compellingly.\nAdhere to professional standards for style, citations, and formatting.\n\nOral Defense\n\nPresent a concise version of the thesis\u2019s argument.\nRespond to questions about the thesis\u2019s structure, evidence, or conclusions.\nExplain the argument\u2019s importance or relevance.\nSpeak fluidly and authoritatively about the thesis.\n\nSenior Thesis Assessment\nA student\u2019s faculty advisors collectively assess the thesis project (written and oral components) on the following criteria:\n\nConceptualization of Research Question and Historical Argument: students acknowledge and explore the full implications of an innovative thesis question.\nFamiliarity with and Understanding of Primary Texts: students engage primary sources to answer their research question and display a creative approach to existing sources or bring new and illuminating sources to bear on their research question.\nEngagement with Secondary Literature: students demonstrate mastery of scholarly literature that pertains to their thesis topic by synthesis of and contribution to the scholarly conversation.\nMethodological and Theoretical Approach: students ground their theses in current knowledge about their historical period, demonstrating a thorough understanding of relevant methodological and theoretical issues.\nQuality of Argument: students construct a well reasoned, well structured, and clearly expressed argument.\nClarity of Writing: writing is consistently engaging, clear, well organized, and enjoyable to read.\nOral Presentation: at the end of the semester, students demonstrate comprehensive understanding of their topic in an articulate and engaging presentation and are able to provide innovative and thoughtful answers to questions. Student demonstrates capacity to connect thesis project to prior coursework in history and related disciplines.\n\nA style guide, along with suggestions for defining a thesis topic, is available on the departmental web page.\nRequirements for Honors\nHonors in history will be granted to those senior majors\u00a0 who, in the department\u2019s judgment, have combined\u00a0 excellent performance in history courses with an excellent\u00a0 overall record. Typically, a grade of 3.7 or higher in a\u00a0 history course reflects honor-quality work.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"History of Art","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nThe major requires ten units, approved by the major advisor.

The department offers a two-track system as guidelines for completing the major in Italian or in Italian Studies. Both tracks require ten courses, including ITAL\u00a0B101\/ITAL\u00a0B102. For students in either Track A or B we recommend a senior experience offered with ITAL\u00a0B398 and ITAL\u00a0B399, courses that are required for honors. Students may complete either track. Recommendations are included below \u2014models of different pathways through the major.\nMajors are required to complete one Writing Intensive (WI) course in the major. The WI courses will prepare students towards their senior project and to competent and appropriate writing, manly in three ways:\n\nTeach the writing process\u2014planning, drafting, revising, and editing;\nEmphasize the role of writing by allocating a substantial portion of the final grade to writing assignments;\nOffer students the opportunity to receive feedback from professors and peers (through class peer review sessions).\n\nIn responding to the feedback, students will experience writing as a process of discovery (re-visioning) and meaning. The goal of the new WI course will be to get students to re-think the argument, logical connection, focus, transition, evidence, quotes, organization, and sources.\nILL Major\/ Track A\nMajor requirements in ILL are 10 courses. Track A may be appropriate for students with an interest in literary and language studies.\nRequired: ITAL\u00a0B101\/ITAL\u00a0B102, plus six courses (or more) conducted in Italian and two selected from among a list of approved ICS courses in English that may be taken in either within the department or in various other disciplines offered at the College (i.e. History, History of Art, English, Visual Art and Film Studies, Philosophy, Comparative Literature, Cities, Archaeology, Classics). Adjustments will be made for students taking courses abroad. Of the courses taken in Italian, students are expected to enroll in the following areas: Dante (ITAL\u00a0B301), Renaissance (ITAL\u00a0B304 or ITAL\u00a0B302), Survey (ITAL\u00a0B307), and two courses on Modern Italian literature (ITAL\u00a0B380, ITAL\u00a0B310, ITAL\u00a0B320, ITAL\u00a0B306)\nICS\/Track B\nMajor requirements in ICS are 10 courses.

Courses must be approved in advance by the Chair of the Italian Studies Department.\nMajor with Honors\nStudents may apply to complete the major with honors. The honors component requires the completion of a year-long thesis advised by a faculty member in the department. Students enroll in the senior year in ITAL\u00a0B398 and ITAL\u00a0B399. Application to it requires a GPA in the major of 3.7 or higher, as well as a written statement, to be submitted by the fall of senior year, outlining the proposed project (see further below) and indicating the faculty member who has agreed to serve as advisor. The full departmental faculty vets the proposals and at the end of the senior year will decide if honors will be given.\nThesis\nStudents will write a 30-35 page thesis that aims to engage with primary texts and relevant secondary literature. By the end of the fall semester, students must have completed a formal proposal and a Table of Content in draft. Proposals for the thesis should describe the questions being asked in the research, and how answers to them will contribute to scholarship. Students must include a discussion of the primary sources on which the research will rest, as well as a preliminary bibliography of relevant secondary studies. They also must include a rough timetable indicating in what stages the work will be completed. It is expected that before submitting their proposals students will have conferred with a faculty member who has agreed to serve as advisor. In December students will formally present the proposal to the department. In April students will give an oral presentation of their work of approximately one hour to faculty members and interested students. The final draft is due on or around April 28th of the senior year and will be graded by two faculty members (one of whom is the advisor).

Does the student demonstrate familiarity with essential literature?\n\nTools and Methods:\n\nDoes the student select and correctly implement methods and formal theories appropriate for their work? Does the student correctly use standard, professional linguistics formatting and notation for transcriptions, glosses, OT tableaux, syntactic structures, semantic interpretations, citations and references, etc.? Does the student correctly use standardly accepted technical jargon (\u201callomorph,\u201d \u201cadjunct,\u201d \u201cimplicature,\u201d etc.) rather than vague descriptions or nonstandard terminology? Does the student correctly use appropriate linguistics technology (Praat, ELAN, etc.)? At the level of technical details, does the student\u2019s work look like it was written by a linguist (rather than, say, by a historian or chemist)?\n\nEthics:\n\nDoes the student demonstrate a full understanding of best practices for responsible and ethical collection, storage, and use of data in ways that respect the relevant speakers and their communities and cultures? Does the student demonstrate a commitment to appropriate collaboration with speakers and communities?\u00a0 (N.B. This learning outcome may not be relevant to work that does not use primary data, in which case, this should normally be assessed as \u201cN\/A\u201d.)\n\nGeneral Scientific Methodology:\n\nData Collection and Presentation\n\tDoes the student demonstrate an understanding of proper scientific methodology for collecting data (survey design, selection of participants, establishing controls, eliciting useful contrasts and paradigms, etc.)? Does the student organize data in meaningful ways that clearly demonstrate important patterns (minimal pairs, morphological paradigm tables, logical blocks of related utterances, etc.)?\nAnalysis\n\tDoes the student construct useful, appropriate hypotheses to explain the observed patterns in the data? Are these hypotheses rigorously and clearly formulated? Does the student sufficiently explore logically plausible alternative hypotheses? Does the student convincingly argue for why their hypotheses are superior to the logical alternatives?\n\nCritical Thinking Skills:\n\nAdvanced Literature\n\tDoes the student draw upon relevant advanced literature in meaningful ways? Does the student demonstrate an understanding of crucial data, analyses, results, models, predictions, etc. from this advanced literature?\nInnovation\n\tIs the student\u2019s work innovative in some way that makes it stand out as more than just superficial description and\/or straightforward application of tried-and-true analytical tools?\u00a0 Does the student articulate novel and insightful claims about a specific language, language itself, or linguistics more broadly? Is the student\u2019s work noteworthy, at least in part, because of the student\u2019s particular insights?\n\nQuality of Prose:\n\nCoherence, Structure, Fluidity, etc.\n\tIs the student\u2019s prose professional and polished, in line with general standards of academic writing? Is the student\u2019s prose clear and logically structured? Are individual sentences coherent and grammatical? Do sentences and paragraphs flow fluidly from one to the next?\u00a0 Does the student\u2019s prose strike an appropriate balance between being concise and being sufficient? Would the student\u2019s prose pass muster for publication in a journal?\n\nRequirements for Honors\nHonors will be granted, at the discretion of the faculty members, to those senior majors who have consistently distinguished themselves in major-related course work (typically with a GPA of 3.7 or higher), active and constructive participation in the intellectual life of the department, and an outstanding senior thesis. A senior major may receive high honors if deemed exceptional in all three areas.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nStudents may minor in linguistics through Haverford by completing six credits in the following four areas:\nMandatory Foundation Courses (three credits)\n\nForms: LING\u00a0H113 or LING S050\u00a0(Introduction to Syntax)\nMeanings: LING\u00a0H114 or LING S040\u00a0(Introduction to Semantics)\nSounds: LING\u00a0H115 or LING S045\u00a0(Phonetics and Phonology)\n\nStructure of a Non-Indo-European Language Courses (one credit)\n\nLING\u00a0H215\u00a0(Structure of Colonial Valley Zapotec)\nLING\u00a0H282\u00a0(Structure of Chinese)\nLING S061 (Structure of Navajo)\nLING S067 (Structure of Wamesa)\nLING S068 (Structure of Kyrgyz)\n\nLanguage, Culture, and Society (one credit)\n\nLING S021 (Anthropological Linguistics)\nLING S025 \/LING H125 (Sociolinguistics)\nLING S041 (Dialects of American English)\nLING S044 (Linguistic Discrimination)\nLING S046 \/LING\u00a0H146\u00a0(Linguistic Diversity)\nLING\/ANTH\u00a0B281\u00a0(Language in the Social Context)\nOther courses which are not being used to fulfil another major requirement may be used here with approval of the chair.\n\nElective Courses (choose one from the following sample of relevant courses among many others):\n\nLING\u00a0B101 or LING\u00a0H101 (Introduction to Linguistics)\nLING\u00a0H204 (Topics in Introductory Programming: Language and Computation)\nCMSC\/LING\u00a0H208 (Speech Synthesis and Recognition)\nLING\/ENGL\u00a0H213 (Inventing [the] English)\nLING\/PSYC\u00a0H238 (The Psychology of Language)\nPHIL\u00a0H253 (Analytic Philosophy of Language)\nPHIL\u00a0H260 (Historical Introduction to Logic)\nLING\/CMSC\u00a0H325 (Computational Linguistics)\nLING\/SPAN\u00a0H365 (The Politics of Language in the Spanish-Speaking World)\n\nThe Tri-Co Linguistics Department accepts all linguistics courses offered at Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford for credit in their appropriate category.\u00a0\u00a0\nNote: Minors in the Tri-Co Linguistics Department can receive up to two elective credits for pre-approved courses taken outside the Tri-Co.

The senior paper is a year-long research project that includes both a written thesis and an oral presentation.\u00a0 All seniors take a year-long senior seminar to support the senior paper. In the seminar, students learn how to use library resources, produce a mathematical document, and take turns presenting portions of their senior papers to each other to develop their skills in constructing and giving oral presentations.\n\u00a0\nIn the fall of the senior year, the student begins to focus on a topic (sometimes an interesting theorem, other times building a mathematical model or analyzing a data set) and works through the material with the faculty advisor. The student completes a detailed thesis proposal, an annotated bibliography, a \"mini-paper,\" and a core fragment of the thesis. In the spring, the student develops the first draft, the second draft, and the final draft of the thesis, and concludes by presenting the thesis to faculty and fellow students.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nOur students will engage with advanced content and techniques in pure mathematics, applied mathematics or statistics. They will gain ownership of the process and material through understanding the content and the details of the problem they are investigating, constructing illustrative examples, carrying out novel computations or carefully analyzing a data set. Our students will write clear, careful and correct mathematics\/statistics, from precise definition or description of a model to rigorous proofs or well-supported analyses. They will develop an oral presentation that highlights the central ideas of their thesis work at a level appropriate for an audience in the mathematical\/statistical sciences.\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe grade for the senior thesis is determined by the following:\n\nLevel of engagement with advanced mathematics or statistics.\nLevel of ownership of the material and of the writing process.\nAdherence to professional standards of written mathematics and statistics.\n\nThe grade for the senior seminar is determined by the following:\n\nCompleting all the assignments in accordance with the assignment description.\nMeeting deadlines for each assignment.\nQuality of intermediate drafts, including whether easily discernible progress has been made from one assignment to another.\nEngaged participation in seminar meetings.\nQuality of the thesis presentation.\n\nPolicies Related to Major Requirements\n\nIn reviewing student thesis topic proposals, the department will prioritize proposals where the topic is in the student's focus, to the extent possible given thesis advisor availability in that focus.\u00a0\nIf a student places past a course listed as required, that requirement is waived, but the student must take an additional course that counts for the major at the 200-level or higher (excluding Junior or Senior Seminar, Senior Research, Teaching Assistant, Independent Study).\u00a0 For example, a student placed past MATH 118 would need to take 1 additional course; a student placed past MATH 121 would need to take 2 additional courses; a student placed past STAT 203 who chooses statistics as their focus would need to take an additional course along with any additional courses implied by their calculus placement.\nIn order to develop a connection between a student and the pool of potential thesis advisors, a major must take at least one course in their chosen focus at Haverford; exceptions to this rule are granted if, at the time of major declaration, the student gets approval from the department chair of a course plan that develops that connection in a different way.\nA student\u2019s transcript can only show one focus, but can minor in a second focus area in certain combinations (see below).\nIn the atypical circumstance that a student elects to graduate in seven semesters, they must inform the department of this choice when they declare their major in the spring of their sophomore year and complete the senior seminar and senior paper during the fall and spring of their junior year, i.e., during their fifth and sixth semesters.\u00a0 (If they have not already taken the junior seminar before the fifth semester, they would also need to take that course during their fifth semester.)\nStudents who graduate nine or more semesters after matriculating should make every effort to complete the Senior Seminar and senior paper during a single academic year (fall then spring), but students in this circumstance can complete these requirements \u201coff-cycle\u201d (spring then fall) with permission of the department chair.\u00a0 This permission should be sought as soon as the student knows of their interest in an off-cycle thesis, and no later than the spring pre-registration immediately preceding their proposed spring-fall thesis year.\u00a0 Off-cycle thesis students may have limited options for thesis advisors, since their spring-fall thesis year will overlap with two different fall-spring faculty sabbatical periods.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinors Offered by the Department\n\nMinor: Pure Math\nMinor: Statistics\nMinor: Applied Math\n\nPure Math Minor Requirements\n\nCalculus II (MATH\u00a0H118)\nMultivariable Calculus (MATH\u00a0H121 or MATH\u00a0H216)\nLinear Algebra (MATH\u00a0H215)\nTwo of the following courses: Analysis (MATH\u00a0H317), Algebra (MATH\u00a0H333), Topology (MATH\u00a0H335)\nOne additional course in pure math (a third course from the previous requirement, or another 200- or 300-level course in pure math)\n\nStatistics Minor Requirements\n\nMultivariable Calculus (MATH\u00a0H121 or MATH\u00a0H216)\nLinear Algebra (MATH\u00a0H215)\nA course in introductory statistics (STAT\u00a0H203, ECON\u00a0H204, PSYC\u00a0H200, or SOCL\u00a0H215)\nProbability (MATH\u00a0H218)\nAdvanced Multivariate Statistical Analysis (STAT\u00a0H361)\nOne additional course in statistics from the following list: Mathematical Statistics (STAT\u00a0H328), Advanced Topics in Statistics (STAT\u00a0H396), or Advanced Econometrics (ECON\u00a0H324)\n\nApplied Math Minor Requirements\n\nCalculus II (MATH\u00a0H118)\nMultivariable Calculus (MATH\u00a0H121 or MATH\u00a0H216)\nLinear Algebra (MATH\u00a0H215)\nDifferential Equations (MATH\u00a0H204)\nTwo additional courses in applied math, of which at least one must be at the 300-level;

Through theory classes our majors gain proficiency in aural and keyboard skills as well as harmony and counterpoint. We emphasize composition in traditional forms as well as experimentation with contemporary styles, and we encourage students to forge their own creative paths. Students also pursue musicology courses that place music in social, religious, and aesthetic contexts and embrace European, North American, and Asian traditions. Students hone their performance skills through participation in our many fine instrumental and vocal ensembles as well as in private study. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\n\nComposition\/Theory: MUSC\u00a0H203, MUSC\u00a0H204, and MUSC\u00a0H303.\nMusicology: A total of three courses:\u00a0 MUSC\u00a0H229, plus any two courses in music history or musicology at the 200 or 300 level.\nTwo full-credit electives in Music at the 200 or 300 level.\nPerformance\n\t\nParticipation in a department-sponsored performance group for at least a year.\nMUSC\u00a0H208, MUSC\u00a0H209, or MUSC\u00a0H210 instrumental or vocal private study for one year.\nWe strongly urge continuing ensemble participation and instrumental or vocal private study.\n\n\nA Senior Project (as detailed below)\nWe expect majors to attend the majority of department-sponsored concerts, lectures, and colloquia.\n\nStudents may take only one elective course abroad or at another institution in the U.S., including within the Tri-College Consortium or at Penn, with prior written approval from the Chair of the Music Department.\nSenior Project\nSenior majors in the Department of Music may choose to undertake their capstone experience by pursuing one of the following focused project options: an original composition or theoretical inquiry; a musicology research paper; a full recital performance; a personalized plan of study within an elective course beyond the number required. In some cases, projects might combine two fields\u2014performance and theory, for example\u2014and may involve joint advisorship. All projects culminate in public presentation appropriate to their nature and scope.\nMajors are asked in February of their junior year to discuss with department faculty members their ideas for the senior experience, identify an advisor, and submit a formal, written project proposal to the Chair before spring break. Proposals are then reviewed by the Music faculty in department meetings. Frequently the department asks that proposals be modified and submitted for a second review before final approval is given. Notification of departmental approval is sent by the chair to students in April. As soon as the project is approved, students are expected to consult with the advisor to determine a clear schedule for the timely completion of work according to the unique needs of the project. Students are often encouraged to get a head start on senior project work well before the beginning of their final fall semester.\nMajors pursuing an independent project in composition\/theory, musicology or performance generally register for MUSC\u00a0H480 in both the fall and spring semesters of their senior year. Each semester of MUSC H480 earns one course credit; however, only one semester of MUSC H480 counts toward the courses required for the major. Majors pursuing the expanded curricular option may be advised to take a preparatory fall MUSC H480, which likewise would earn one course credit, but not apply toward fulfillment of major requirements.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\n\nIn the process of preparing an original composition, the student exercises the ability to compose a substantial work (e.g., string quartet, song cycle, piano sonata) exhibiting proficiency in notation, clarity of structure, stylistic integrity, and awareness of historical models. In pursuing a theoretical inquiry, the student engages in the analysis of musical content through primary and secondary sources, aiming for a synthesis of perspectives and an expression of insights sensitive to music\u2019s interpretive possibilities.\nIn the process of preparing a senior thesis in musicology, the student develops the ability to craft an original research question based on knowledge of and reflection upon prior literature in the field. The student will also demonstrate command of appropriate musicological research methods, clear written expression, and the capacity to speak with authority about the topic in a public presentation.\nIn the process of preparing a senior recital, the student hones the skills to present a technically and interpretively challenging program of repertory from a range of stylistic periods.\nIn the process of fulfilling a program of intensified study within an additional course elective, the student expands curricular horizons, and meets the highest-level challenges in their experience as a major.\n\nRegardless of the specific path taken, it is intended that the senior experience stimulate reflection on the discipline of music as a whole, and lead to the student\u2019s awareness of place within the unfolding history of musical creativity, scholarship and performance. Each project should in its own way constitute a consummation of the student\u2019s musical growth throughout the undergraduate years.\nSenior Project Assessment\nWhether undertaken in the context of an intensified elective or of an independent study the actual numerical grade assigned for the senior project remains at advisor discretion. The department as a body discusses the project\u2019s relative quality and the consistency of effort brought to bear in its production, to aid the advisor in evaluation.\u00a0 A written summary of the department\u2019s collective appraisal of the student\u2019s achievement in the senior experience is furnished by the chair to the student prior to Commencement.\nRequirements for Honors\nHonors\n\nMinimum GPA in music courses of 3.7 AND grade on senior project of 4.0.\n\nHigh Honors\n\nOutstanding, standard-setting contribution to the department in the context of courses and\/or ensembles.\nExceptional level of originality, depth, and synthesis in the senior project as compared to undergraduate work generally, outside Haverford (i.e., a level of work that should be sufficient to gain admission to top graduate programs in the field).\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\nComposition\/Theory: MUSC\u00a0H203 and MUSC\u00a0H204.\nMusicology: A total of two courses:\u00a0 MUSC\u00a0H229, plus one course in music history or musicology at the 200 or 300 level\nOne full-credit elective in Music at the 200 or 300 level.\nMUSC\u00a0H208, MUSC\u00a0H209, MUSC\u00a0H210 instrumental\/vocal private study or department ensemble participation for one year.\nWe expect minors to attend the majority of department-sponsored concerts, lectures, and colloquia.\n\nStudents may take only one elective course abroad or at another institution in the U.S., including within the Tri-College Consortium or at Penn, with prior written approval from the Chair of the Music Department.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Neuroscience","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur curriculum aims to ground students in the field of neuroscience while allowing them to explore the range of interconnected disciplines.

We strongly encourage students to combine courses in creative ways to reflect their unique goals and interests. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConcentration Requirements\nThe concentration combines three core courses with three elective courses focused on a particular theoretical problem, geographical region, or comparative study. Ideally, students meet with the director in the spring of their sophomore year to work out a plan for the concentration.\nCore Courses\nWe require all concentrators to take three core courses:\n\nPEAC\u00a0H101 (Introduction to PJHR)\nPEAC\u00a0H201 (Applied Ethics of PJHR)\nPEAC\u00a0H395 (Capstone Seminar in PJHR)\n\nAlternate courses may on occasion fulfill a core requirement.\n\u00a0\nElectives\nWe require students to take three additional elective courses for the concentration.There is no set list of courses, which \u201ccount\u201d as electives; instead, we ask students to design a thoughtful focus for their work, and choose courses in consultation with the concentration director, working out a plan that focuses the concentration regionally, conceptually, or around a particular substantive problem. A course does not have to have \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201cjustice\u201d in its title or content to count toward the concentration. The aim is to articulate a focus that helps each student pursue their interests in PJHR.\nThe concentration may overlap with students\u2019 majors by one or two courses\u2014any course could potentially count toward two programs. (For instance, for political science majors with a concentration in PJHR and a focus on questions of sovereignty, POLS\u00a0H266 could fill requirements in both political science and PJHR.) Such overlap is a possibility, not a requirement. Each student works out a plan of study appropriate to their focus with the concentration director. No more than two of the six credits for the concentration may come from institutions outside of the Bi-Co, and all credits from outside of the Bi-Co should be proposed to the director for approval.\nSenior Project\nAll PJHR seniors will take a capstone course in the fall of their senior year that will help concentrators integrate scholarship, theory, library and field research, and policy perspectives, and communicate about the work they are doing in their majors with students from other disciplines. The capstone incorporates discussion, research assignments, collaboration, a student-organized conference, and a dossier of student work in the concentration. Note: Work for the thesis in each student\u2019s major may overlap with work for the concentration but need not.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe aim of the capstone is to consolidate student experience of a program that integrates scholarship, theory, policy perspectives, and library, field and lab research. Students are encouraged to look critically at their own social justice philosophies and disciplinary methods, and reflect on how practice and theory are, at the same time, challenges to each other and yet not strictly separable. The capstone is also a site at which collaborative work across the disciplines may help students begin to envision innovative new solutions to entrenched problems. At the very least, students will learn how to communicate meaningfully about their work to other students who may not share disciplinary methodologies or assumptions. The goal is for students to connect this form of communication with a kind of ethical leadership and\/or engagement that relies as much on productive listening as it does on speech or action.\nTo that end, during the course of the seminar, students engage in conversation around a theme and shared readings across disciplinary differences; engage in the work of teaching each other how the methodologies of their different disciplines formulate and answer important questions (through the presentation of articles in their field and of their own work); propose a research paper or collaborative project related to the work of their major, and work on drafting a version of it suitable for an interdisciplinary audience; collaborate on planning an end-of-semester conference showcasing their work; present their work-in-progress at the conference; and engage other students\u2019 work in ways both formal (serving as discussants on other students\u2019 papers) and informal (responding to presentations and posing or answering questions about them).\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Philosophy","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur faculty reflects the rich diversity of the discipline\u2019s methods, approaches, and subject matter.

Each of our classes fosters in our students the ability to read philosophical texts critically, to engage in productive discussions as listeners and contributors, and to communicate their ideas clearly and persuasively.\nMajors begin with an introductory level course of their choice (one is required), then move on to 200- and 300-level courses (eight are required). Of the eight, one must cover the history of European philosophy prior to Kant and three must cover a series of specific topics (including value theory, metaphysics and epistemology, and logic\/philosophy of language.) In addition, at least four of the eight required courses must fall under a coherent theme or subject. In their final year, majors participate in Senior Seminar and produce a Senior Thesis.\nMinors also begin with an introductory level course of their choice (one is required), then move on to 200- and 300-level courses (five are required). Of the five, one must cover value theory, one must address metaphysics and epistemology, and one must include philosophical texts written before the 20th century.\nThe program is enriched by an array of extra- and co-curricular programs that bring faculty, students, as well as leading academics from around the world together to examine philosophical issues.

This two course seminar (PHIL\u00a0H399A and PHIL\u00a0H399B) comprises\n\na year-long research project culminating in a senior thesis,\nstudent presentations and discussion of the students\u2019 works-in-progress in preparation for the final, formal presentation of the thesis at the end of the spring term, and\nseminars with visiting speakers throughout the senior year.\n\nThe senior thesis (thirty pages) is on a topic of the student\u2019s choice. It is written under the supervision of a first reader who meets with the student on a regular basis throughout the year, usually weekly. A second reader also reads and comments on the student\u2019s written work and may also meet regularly with the student. In the fall, students write a twenty-page research paper introducing the literature on the topic and the issues it involves. In the spring, students build on this base, developing an analysis of the issues and an argument in defense of the conclusions drawn. A draft of the thesis is submitted in March; the final version is due the end of April.\nAfter a very short initial presentation in the fall to introduce their research topics, students give three substantial presentations of their work: at the end of the fall semester, in March, and in May. Each presentation is followed by a question period.\nIn preparation for the fall Altherr Symposium, featuring a speaker of the students\u2019 choice, students and faculty read works by the Altherr speaker, and students prepare discussion questions both for the Symposium lecture and for the seminar with the speaker. Seniors also attend all other invited speaker events, of which there are four or five over the course of the year, and they have a short seminar with each speaker to further discuss the presented work.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nIn the process of researching and writing the senior thesis, students should acquire and demonstrate:\n\nthe ability to articulate a philosophically rich but also manageable research question.\nthe ability to locate and to learn from relevant work on the topic by other philosophers.\nthe ability to assess critically and fairly other positions and views, and to develop arguments in support of those assessments.\nthe ability to explain in a compelling way the philosophical interest of the research topic and to develop a sustained and cogent philosophical argument for the conclusions reached.\n\nIn the course of repeated presentations and discussions, students should acquire and demonstrate:\n\nthe capacity to develop and enact thoughtful and effective presentations.\nthe ability to respond constructively to presentations on a very wide range of philosophical topics, even those with which one is unfamiliar.\nthe ability to respond productively to questions about and criticisms of one\u2019s work.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nA student\u2019s faculty advisors collectively assess the thesis project (written and oral components) on the following criteria:\n\nConceptualization of Research Question and Historical Argument: Students acknowledge and explore the full implications of an innovative thesis question.\nFamiliarity with and Understanding of Primary Texts: Students engage primary sources to answer their research question and display a creative approach to existing sources or bring new and illuminating sources to bear on their research question.\nEngagement with Secondary Literature: Students demonstrate mastery of scholarly literature that pertains to their thesis topic by synthesis of and contribution to the scholarly conversation.\nMethodological and Theoretical Approach: Students ground their theses in current knowledge about their historical period, demonstrating a thorough understanding of relevant methodological and theoretical issues.\nQuality of Argument: Students construct a well-reasoned, well-structured, and clearly expressed argument.\nClarity of Writing: Writing is consistently engaging, clear, well organized, and enjoyable to read.\nOral Presentation: At the end of the semester, students demonstrate comprehensive understanding of their topic in an articulate and engaging presentation and are able to provide innovative and thoughtful answers to questions. Students demonstrate capacity to connect thesis project to prior coursework in history and related disciplines.\n\nRequirements for Honors\nThe award of honors in philosophy will be based upon distinguished work in philosophy courses, active and constructive participation in the senior seminar, and the writing and presentation of the senior essay. High honors requires in addition exceptional and original work in the senior essay.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\nOne philosophy course at the 100 level, or Bryn Mawr PHIL\u00a0B101\u00a0or\u00a0PHIL\u00a0B102, or the equivalent elsewhere.\nThree philosophy courses at the 200 level.\nTwo philosophy courses at the 300 level.\n\nAmong the 200- and 300-level courses: one must be in value theory (broadly conceived to include ethics, social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and legal philosophy), one must be in metaphysics and epistemology (including ontology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of action), and one must be concerned with philosophical texts written before the twentieth century.

For students interested in graduate study in experimental physics, it is helpful to also take H326. For students interested in graduate study in theoretical\/computational, it is helpful to also take a course relating to scientific computing, such as PHYS H304 or MATH H222. Any student interested in graduate study in any field should consult with their advisor for the courses that make the most sense for their particular case.\nSenior Project\nThe senior research program demonstrates achievement in depth in a particular subfield of physics or astrophysics. Students participate in PHYS H399, a year-long, \u00bd credit per semester senior seminar.\u00a0 We assess students by their performance on a short talk during the fall semester, a comprehensive talk or poster presentation in the spring semester and a senior thesis written in the form of a scientific paper.\nIn addition, as part of the year-long senior seminar, senior physics majors study topics in scientific integrity in two student-led meetings, using readings and role-playing scenarios to learn best practices in the ethical conduct of research. They also receive training in life after Haverford, including how to choose and apply to graduate schools, and what careers are available outside science for physics majors.\nStudents are expected to place their senior research work in the context of the scientific literature in their field of study, and to present their results to an audience of professionals (for their thesis) and their peers (for the talk or poster). They are given training in searching and reading the scientific literature by each research supervisor, as well as specific materials through the senior seminar course.\nMost students also take a senior research course for credit (though this is not required). Their work in this course also assesses their research accomplishments.\u00a0\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nWe expect senior research in physics to demonstrate:\n\na clear understanding of the scientific context of the research (including a review of the relevant scientific literature).\nmastery of the content and findings of the research.\nindependent problem solving and ability to synthesize material.\nan understanding of the forward looking implications of the research findings.\nclarity in the public presentation of the research.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nThe evaluation of students\u2019 overall work in the senior seminar includes both their content knowledge in their research area, and their ability to communicate this work.\u00a0 In the fall semester, students write up the introduction and background sections of their senior thesis while getting training in researching and reading the scientific literature and properly referencing their bibliographic sources. They receive formative assessment from their senior thesis advisor on the fall paper, including suggestions for improvements on the final thesis. For the senior thesis, there are multiple rounds of assessment, since students get ongoing feedback from their research supervisors while writing their thesis, and they submit two distinct formal drafts which are read carefully by two faculty members who give extensive feedback. After each round, students must respond to this feedback while preparing their final thesis.\nSimilarly, each student gives a first short (10 minute) research talk in the fall and is given department-wide comments about how to improve this talk before they prepare and give their final senior presentation. Typically, each student practices each presentation several times, receiving detailed feedback from a supervisor in between to ensure they present their work at a level comparable with that of poster presentations and short talks at the American Physical Society or other comparable annual meetings.\nThe thesis research itself is evaluated for\n\na demonstrated understanding of the context and content of the research (including a review of the relevant scientific literature),\nindependent problem solving and synthesis, and\nsuccess in understanding the forward looking implications of the research.\n\nThe written and oral presentations of the research are evaluated for\n\na clear and appropriate writing style and\nwell-curated visual displays of the research.\n\nA further confirmation of quality is the number of senior research projects that lead to publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\nRequirements for Honors\nThe departmental awards for honors in physics are based on the quality of performance in course work and the senior colloquium and paper. High honors carries the additional requirement of demonstrated originality in senior research.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\n\nPHYS\u00a0H105 (or PHYS\u00a0H101 or PHYS\u00a0H115) and PHYS\u00a0H106\u00a0(or PHYS\u00a0H102); PHYS\u00a0H213, PHYS\u00a0H214, and\u00a0PHYS\u00a0H211\u00a0lab\u00a0(or Bryn Mawr equivalents).\nMATH\u00a0H121 (or MATH\u00a0H216) and MATH\u00a0H215 (or one of: MATH\u00a0H222, MATH B203 [the Bryn Mawr equivalent of MATH H215], or another 200-level mathematics course with permission).\nOne of the four \u201ccore\u201d 300-level lecture courses in physics at Haverford or Bryn Mawr: PHYS\u00a0H302, PHYS\u00a0H303, PHYS\u00a0H308, or PHYS\u00a0H309.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nAstrophysics Major \nAstronomy Major and Minor \nBiophysics Concentration \nScientific Computing Concentration \nEducation Minor and Concentration \n\n\n"},{"major":"Political Science","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nOur faculty possess expertise in five subfields\u2014American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Politics, Global Governance, and Political Theory\u2014and we require majors to complete coursework in three of the five subfields. Committed to relevance as well as breadth, we offer an ever-growing array of courses. Among them are classes that arise out of today\u2019s most pressing issues\u2014from terrorism to income inequality, to mobilization politics\u2014and those that enmesh students in the world around them through policy making projects, international field trips, and internships in the political and governmental sectors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\n\nTwo of the following 100-level courses to enter the major: POLS\u00a0H121, POLS\u00a0H131, POLS\u00a0H151, POLS\u00a0H161, and POLS\u00a0H171. These courses must represent two different subfields.\nSix elective courses taken above the 100 level.\u00a0No more than four of the elective courses for the major may come from institutions outside of the Tri-Co.\nA 300-level research seminar, taken in the department during the fall semester of the senior year. (This is in addition to the six elective courses described above.)\nA combination of introductory and elective courses that includes representation of three of the five subfields, with work at the intermediate or advanced level in at least two subfields.\n\t\nStudents may count some courses in either of the two subfields but not in both.\nWith the consent of a member of the department, students may substitute two or three intermediate- or advanced-level courses from another department for the third subfield, where this serves to complement and strengthen the student\u2019s work within the department. For example, a student concentrating in international politics might offer international economics courses as a subfield; a student in comparative politics might offer courses in an area study; a student in political theory might offer social and political philosophy courses; or a student in American politics might offer social policy courses. Students can count such substitutions towards fulfilling the subfield requirement only. They cannot count these towards political science course credit and cannot use them to fulfill the introductory, elective, and seminar requirements outlined above.\n\n\nAll senior majors write a thesis and complete an oral defense of the thesis through enrollment in POLS\u00a0H400.\n\nSenior Project\nThe senior thesis represents the capstone of the political science major. It is a year-long independent research project designed and implemented by each senior political science major with the guidance and support of an assigned thesis advisor. Students receive one credit for an advanced-level seminar in the fall semester of their senior year. With few exceptions, this seminar is taken with the student\u2019s thesis advisor. During the fall semester seminar students select a research topic, formulate a research question, begin acquiring conceptual and theoretical sophistication through a comprehensive review of the relevant scholarly literature, and prepare a thesis proposal or research design. This proposal will guide each student\u2019s original research during the spring semester. Near the end of the fall semester seniors submit their thesis proposals to all members of the department and present their thesis proposals before the department faculty and fellow students. These proposal defenses are intended to provide students with useful critical feedback during the fall semester when there is still time to make major adjustments to the project if necessary. They are also intended to build an esprit de corps among majors while giving them valuable experience with oral presentation and public accountability.\nIn the spring semester students register for POLS\u00a0H400, a supervised research and writing course. During this semester, students conduct independent research and write up their findings with the guidance and feedback of their advisor. Throughout the spring semester students meet regularly with their thesis advisor and submit drafts of thesis chapters to their advisor. After students submit their final written theses in April, they are required to give a 30-minute oral defense of their theses to their advisor and at least one other political science faculty member in early May.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe goal of the thesis is to promote the ongoing acquisition of research and analytical skills, as well as the ability to carry out extensive projects independently and consistent with the highest standards of excellence. Most students writing a thesis will identify an interesting and important research question, explore how other scholars have attempted to address that question, and devise a viable research plan. Students who choose to concentrate in political theory pursue normative research and focus on interpretation and analysis of philosophical texts. Students are expected to conduct their own research, often using both primary and secondary sources, and to evaluate how their findings relate to existing scholarship in the field.\nSenior Project Assessment\nStudents are assessed based upon their proposal, their written thesis, their oral defense, and their performance throughout the thesis process. They are evaluated according to several criteria, including:\n\ntheir conceptualization of a research question.\ntheir ability to effectively and concisely present their argument and findings.\ntheir ability to draw conclusions and extensions of their research to broader arenas.\ntheir engagement with secondary material and use of primary sources.\ntheir ability to identify, critique, develop, and apply core concepts and theories.\ntheir ability to obtain a basic understanding of research methodologies.\ntheir ability to comprehend and respond to questioning.\nthe quality and organization of their writing.\nthe timely submission of work and responsiveness to feedback.\nthe originality of their ideas and the ambition of their project.\nthe breadth of their knowledge related to their thesis topic.\nthe depth of their knowledge related to their thesis topic.\ntheir comprehension of the scope and limitations of their own research.\n\nDuring the fall semester, students receive feedback from their professor and their peers on various assignments that often include a combination of the following: thesis proposal, annotated bibliography and literature review. The presentation of the thesis proposal in the fall semester is an opportunity for members in the department other than the advisor to weigh in on and evaluate a student\u2019s progress. The feedback received in the fall from fellow students and the department faculty at the thesis proposal defense is beneficial for students as they move ahead with their projects in the spring.\nThroughout the spring semester students receive feedback from their thesis advisor through regular meetings and comments on thesis drafts. The schedule for the submission of drafts and individual meetings in the spring semester is determined by the student and his\/her advisor. Prior to the oral defense of the thesis in May each student submits a thesis abstract. This abstract is an important element of the defense in that it is designed to serve as a succinct overview of the thesis argument and methodology. The defense is attended by the student, the thesis advisor, and one other member of the department faculty. After the defense, the two faculty members discuss the student\u2019s project and overall performance. Ultimate responsibility for grading of the thesis (POLS H400) belongs to the supervising faculty member.\nRequirements for Honors\nThe department awards honors to senior majors who have demonstrated excellence in their coursework in political science and their senior thesis. The department may grant high honors to a select number of senior majors who have attained an outstanding level of distinction in their political science courses and senior thesis.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"major":"Psychology","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nWith strengths in neuroscience, cognitive, cultural, social, and personality psychology, the Department is distinguished by faculty who are accomplished scholars as well as extraordinary teachers. On any given day, you will find faculty and students working side-by-side on primary research in areas that include cognitive neuroscience, music and time perception, the neurobiology of sex, identity development, friendships across cultures, and romantic relationship maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMajor Requirements\nThe psychology major contains a breadth requirement, a general research requirement, a discipline-specific research requirement, and a senior project, as described below:\nBreadth Requirement\n\nOne semester of introductory psychology: PSYC\u00a0H100 (Foundations of Psychology).\nPSYC\u00a0H200 (Experimental Methods and Statistics), or Bryn Mawr PSYC\u00a0B205.\nSix additional psychology courses beyond the introductory level, with at least one taken from each of the following groups:\n\t\nsocial and personality psychology\nbiological psychology\ncognition.\n\t\tOne of these courses must be a full-credit 300-level course (i.e., a seminar).\n\n\nSee the Psychology Student Guidebook on the departmental website for details on which classes fulfill each of these groups.\nTwo laboratory courses.\nOne of the following senior thesis options:\n\t\ntwo semesters of empirical senior research or\na one semester non-empirical senior thesis and an additional psychology course beyond the introductory level.\n\n\n\nWe typically accept equivalent courses within the Tri-Co, with permission of the department, to fulfill major requirements. However, not all courses in other departments fit into the above designated areas. See the Psychology Student Guidebook for more information. As a general rule, no more than two courses taken outside of the Tri-Co may count toward the psychology major. This includes courses taken for a study abroad program. All courses taken outside of the Tri-Co for major credit must be submitted to the department for approval.\nResearch Requirement\nThe research requirement of the major trains students to think scientifically about psychological questions and to understand empirical approaches to the discipline. In addition, students obtain hands-on training in conducting behavioral research and answering original research questions.\nGeneral Research Training\nStudents take one semester of Experimental Methods and Statistics (PSYC\u00a0H200). In this lecture and lab course, students will learn the principles of statistics and research design. In lab sessions, students put the statistical techniques that they learn during lectures into practice by designing and conducting several different kinds of data collection and analyses. This course is equivalent to PSYC\u00a0B205 at Bryn Mawr; either PSYC\u00a0H200 or PSYC\u00a0B205 will be offered in each semester. Either of these courses is a prerequisite for the following lab course requirement.\nDiscipline-Specific Research Training\n\nLab courses: One half-credit 300-level lab course for psychology majors in the graduating classes of 2021 and 2022. These courses must be taken in the Haverford Psychology Department and typically have PSYC\u00a0H200\u00a0as a prerequisite.\nSenior Research: By the time psychology majors reach the senior year, they are well prepared to carry out their senior research requirement. If students choose the year-long original empirical project, they will be involved in all phases of the research process; from formulating the questions, designing the study, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting the research both orally and in writing. If students choose the one-semester non-empirical thesis, they will conduct an in-depth literature review of a given topic along with their own original synthesis and analysis of the issues.\n\nSenior Project\nThe senior thesis experience is the capstone of the psychology major. In a typical thesis project, each student works closely with a faculty advisor and a small group of fellow seniors to carry out an original research study. A detailed description of this process is set out in the annual departmental Guide to the Psychology Senior Thesis Experience (available as PDF download or from the department chair).\nIn the course of this project, students apply skills and knowledge that they acquired during previous coursework in the psychology major. Thesis students do not merely learn about research that has already been done in psychology. Rather, they collect new data to address questions of interest. In this way, the thesis embodies the highest level of scholarship, in which students strive to contribute original knowledge to the field.\nThe thesis project is typically carried out over two semesters. In the first semester, students work to identify a conceptual question of interest, read and integrate background literature on that topic, and formulate a novel research plan. In the second semester, students carry out their proposed studies by collecting data, statistically analyzing the results of the study, and interpreting how the results relate to the study\u2019s original hypothesis. Both semesters involve intensive writing, with detailed feedback from the faculty advisor.\nAn alternative option is a one-semester, non-empirical project that may be appropriate in some circumstances. In the one-semester project, a student conducts an in-depth literature review of a given topic along with their own original synthesis and analysis of the issues, and submits a paper that relates this work.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe senior thesis is envisioned as a capstone experience in which students are required to integrate the content knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier parts of our curriculum to a specific research question of interest. This, in turn, leads to increasingly sophisticated critical thinking skills that vary somewhat between one vs. two semester projects but can be summarized as follows:\nFor two semester projects, students are to:\n\nthoroughly review the extant literatures on the chosen topic and integrate those literatures into a cohesive rationale for an empirical project.\ndevelop and articulate testable hypotheses that are contextualized within the psychological literature using the scientific method of inquiry.\ndesign and conduct a rigorously conceived empirical study to test the stated hypotheses, using the methods that are normative within that discipline.\nanalyze the empirical data that has been collected using the appropriate statistical techniques to test the stated hypotheses, and interpret those analyses with respect to the stated hypotheses.\ndescribe the results of the study using\n\t\ncorrect statistical notation and\nclear, concise, and accessible language.\n\n\ninterpret the results and discuss how they relate to past research findings and\/or theory on the chosen topic.\nidentify the strengths and limitations of the current project.\nimagine directions for future research and applications based on the findings of the study conducted.\nwork cohesively within a collaborative lab group (if conducting research in a group).\ncommunicate the study in the form of a written research report that is clear and sophisticated with regards to scholarly writing.\npresent the project orally to the department (faculty and peers) clearly and concisely.\ndemonstrate mastery of the research topic and ownership of the empirical project.\n\nFor one-semester projects, students are to:\n\nthoroughly review the extant literatures on the chosen topic and integrate those literatures into a cohesive summary of past work.\ndevelop a novel theoretical framework or original application of the literature.\ncommunicate their work in the form of a written manuscript that is clear and sophisticated with regards to scholarly writing.\npresent the project orally to the department (faculty and peers) clearly and concisely.\ndemonstrate mastery of the research topic and ownership of the project.\n\nSenior Project Assessment\nSenior thesis work is assessed via two main components: the strength of the student\u2019s paper and their contribution to the thesis project.\n\nThe paper is evaluated on a number of criteria, including the thoroughness of the background literature review, its overall organization, accuracy, style, the student\u2019s creative input, their ability to integrate different ideas in a novel and cogent fashion and finally, whether arguments and conclusions are persuasive given the issues at hand. Each student is expected to hand in an individual paper, even if working as part of a thesis group.\nThe student\u2019s degree of active involvement in the senior thesis experience is also assessed. During the fall semester, we consider the extent to which each student helps shape the study questions, design, and methodology of the project. During the spring, we consider the effort expended in the data collection and analysis phases of the study, and the contribution to project presentations and the final poster. Although the paper is weighted more heavily than the project contribution in arriving at the final course grade, it is possible to write an excellent paper but receive a significantly lower grade due to insufficient involvement with the project.\n\nThe primary research advisor and second reader will evaluate work based on the above criteria. Final grades are determined by a consensus process involving all department members, who will discuss each student\u2019s performance and compare it with other students, both past and present, in order to arrive at a fair evaluation of your work.\nFor a two-semester thesis, the following criteria are used grading the first semester paper:\n4.0 work for the first semester indicates a paper that has gone above and beyond a summary of the relevant literature in terms of scope, synthesis and integration. In addition to reflecting a nearly flawless paper that provides a coherent rationale for the study to be undertaken, this grade can also represent exceptional or original independent contributions, or individual effort that has gone beyond what is normally expected. A grade of 4.0 is not commonly awarded during the first semester.\n3.7 work for the first semester indicates an extremely thorough, coherently organized, and generally well-written summary of the literature that identifies all of the seminal work that has led up to the current study. In addition, this grade reflects that the rationale for the current study is abundantly clear and the procedures to be used are well-described. There may be improvements that can be made to this paper, but there are no major areas of deficiency.\n3.3 work for the first semester reflects a good to very good paper that needs improvement in one or more areas. The literature review may need to be more thorough, or the literature better summarized or integrated. The writing may be choppy or difficult to follow in some areas. There may be conceptual gaps that lead to an incomplete rationale for the study to be undertaken.\n3.0 work for the first semester indicates that although the paper is good, there are several areas in which improvement can be made. For example, the literature review may have been too scant or poorly integrated. That is, the paper may have included summaries of appropriate studies without integrating how those studies support an important point or how they relate to the study that you are undertaking. The literature review may not have been thorough enough or may have relied too heavily on non-primary sources. In general, the reader may have had a difficult time understanding how the literature review culminates in the problem to be addressed in the current study.\nRequirements for Honors\nThe department awards honors to majors who show exceptionally high attainment in their coursework and demonstrate work in senior research or senior thesis and related research courses that is of superior quality.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMinor Requirements\nThe Haverford minor in psychology consists of six credits in psychology including:\n\nPSYC\u00a0H100 (Foundations of Psychology), and\nFive additional psychology courses beyond the introductory level, with at least one from two of the following groups:\n\t\nsocial and personality psychology\nbiological psychology\ncognition.\n\n\n\nSee the Guidebook on the departmental website for details on which classes fulfill the requirements for each of these groups. As a general rule, no more than two courses taken outside of the Tri-Co may count toward the psychology minor. This includes courses taken for a study abroad program. All courses taken outside of the Tri-Co for major credit must be submitted to the department for approval.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Programs and Concentrations\n\nNeuroscience Minor \n\n\n"},{"major":"Religion","text":"\n\nCurriculum & Courses\n\n\n\nWith faculty possessing expertise in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and African American religions, as well as a range of methodologies, we engage students in the breadth of religious studies scholarship.

Normally, the department will grant such credit if the courses enhance the integrity of a program grounded in the Haverford curriculum.\nSenior Project\nSociology majors must complete a senior thesis, which is a year-long research project. The thesis serves as a culmination of the department\u2019s aims of having students \u201cdo sociology.\u201d In preparation they will have taken many classes inside the department that have provided them with opportunities to understand critical theoretical debates in the literature and have introduced them to different research traditions within the discipline. These courses also provide the opportunity to examine shorter theoretical topics, as well as write shorter research papers. The senior thesis is the longest and most involved writing assignment, and as such presents students with an opportunity to complete a real research project.\nThe senior thesis consists of two courses, SOCL\u00a0H450A and SOCL\u00a0H450B. Each senior is required to formulate a research topic that addresses a theoretical problem that they evaluate through empirical investigations. Each senior selects and works regularly with a primary advisor, with whom they meet weekly, as part of a group and\/or individually. They spend the fall semester refining their argument, working to construct an answerable research question that is generally based on concerns that have come from their previous coursework. Each senior also presents their work periodically to all department faculty and seniors. Students present their research problem, a report on how the work is developing, and a draft of a theoretical or an empirical section. This process provides the opportunity for students to develop their oral presentation skills. The process also encourages and facilitates the ability of students to work with more than one member of the faculty on their theses. These meetings also serve to foster cooperation and support among the students.\nThe spring semester is spent further backing up their argument with their empirical work, and revising the thesis into a completed form. Students continue to meet with their primary thesis advisors, collectively and\/or individually every week. They continue to make oral presentations to the faculty and seniors in the department, culminating in a final public presentation before the department, including junior and newly declared sophomore majors, as well as invited guests.\nSenior Project Learning Goals\nThe goals of the senior thesis process are to:\n\nprovide students with an opportunity to pursue an original research question.\nallow them to develop arguments that are longer in length and more empirically supported than in research papers submitted in lower-level courses in the major.\nfurther develop research skills, including literature review and empirical analysis.\nimprove their writing and oral presentation skills.\n\nIn regular classes faculty specify the nature of the work to be undertaken. Here students assume responsibility for their own work. They define their own research agenda autonomously\u2014even if assisted by their advisors, and other faculty in (and outside of) the department\u2014and they are expected to create a masterwork that manifests their ability to \u201cdo sociology.\u201d\nSenior Project Assessment\nEach student\u2019s work is then evaluated by all faculty in the department.

We seek to equip our graduates to find innovative solutions to enduring problems by cultivating collaboration, problem-solving and moral discernment. Increasingly, solutions to local and global challenges require insights from engineers, especially when addressing social mobility, caring for the environment, reducing poverty and promoting human welfare. Our graduates will benefit from thorough technical and scientific training and the interdisciplinary sensitivity and moral imagination of the Christian liberal arts. We've embraced the challenge from the National Science Foundation to prepare adaptive engineers committed to blending science, engineering and the arts.\u00a0Westmont Engineering is distinctive in many ways. Our program is built around three pillars:Excellence in technical engineering training learned in small classes, focused on hands-on active learning, with professors that are very engaged with their studentsIntegration of Engineering Design and Innovation throughout the curriculumA solid Christian liberal arts foundationWestmont Engineering grants a BS in General Engineering that provides the largest set of possibilities for specialization, job opportunities and graduate school options. Our curriculum starts with our Christian liberal arts core and then combines a solid math and science foundation with in-depth content in all the critical technical areas of engineering. Our small class sizes (average engineering class size is about 10 students) are taught by Christian faculty who are experts in their fields. The small class sizes provide great opportunities for \u201clearning by doing\u201d, where we emphasize hands-on, design-oriented experiences that make the technical content come to life. In addition, the small classes allow you to really get to know your professors.Our focus on engineering design and on innovation also distinguishes our program. Design is what differentiates engineering from other technical disciplines. Engineers create (design) products, processes and services to help people. This fits seamlessly into our Christian distinctiveness as we endeavor to love people by designing to help them live better lives. Westmont engineering has multiple courses where Design Innovation (DI) plays a central role. These courses include the first-year class \u201cEngineering and the Liberal Arts\u201d, the \u201cJunior Design\u201d class which focuses on designing to serve others and the 2-semester Senior Capstone Design courses where we work on industry sponsored projects. In addition, the Westmont Engineering curriculum weaves DI throughout the engineering curriculum by including mini design experiences that use the technical content for that course in a design experience.The Christian liberal arts foundation of our engineering program provides a wonderful base for our engineering graduates to excel in their careers. While engineering practice requires great technical competence, engineering industry is increasingly demanding the thoughtfulness and skill set that a Christian liberal arts emphasis provides. Skills such as leadership, teamwork, conflict management skills, interpersonal skills, empathy and negotiation, as well as written and oral communication skills are seen as critical for successful engineering work.Westmont Engineering works to integrate our professional endeavors with our faith experience.\u00a0This is especially true as we creatively design things that help improve people\u2019s lives. As Christian engineers, this aligns with Christ\u2019s command to \u201clove others as ourselves\u201d (Matt. 22:39). \u00a0In particular, our junior design course has an emphasis on \u201cdesigning for service\u201d.Engineering graduates have tremendous opportunities across a broad range of possibilities.\u00a0Engineers have opportunities in industries such as design, energy, sustainability, environmental resources, robotics, automation, vehicle design, aeronautics, space, manufacturing and internet of things (IoT).\u00a0International opportunities are available both during the time at Westmont and after graduation. Opportunities for females and ethnic minorities are especially abundant. In addition to all the engineering-specific highlights of the Westmont Engineering program detailed above, our students have the privilege of living in beautiful Santa Barbara, CA.\u00a0Living just minutes from both the beach and the mountains is quite a thrill!\u00a0Being just far enough from Los Angeles to avoid the traffic, but close enough to go enjoy the big city when you want to, is also wonderful.Designing a Strong and Innovative Engineering ProgramProposed Building to House Engineering"},{"major":"Engineering Physics","text":"Physicists seek a fundamental understanding of the physical universe.

Bauer College of Business\u00a0\u00a0>\u00a0Department of Decision and Information Sciences\u00a0\u00a0>\u00a0Management Information Systems, B.B.A.The demand for MIS skills has seen a tremendous resurgence in the past few years. Forecasts are extremely strong with MIS skill sets dominating the top job roles expected to grow in the future. While the MIS careers are expected to expand at an accelerated rate, the mix of skill requirements has changed considerably. With the explosive growth of technology accompanying the usage of the Internet in the late 1990s, the role of application development (programming) dominated the MIS field. Since then, outsourcing has moved many of the low level programming jobs overseas. However, the increased need for higher level technology jobs has become prevalent. Now, the web, communication and database technologies are maturing and their usage has begun to extend throughout every area of business practices. These new information technologies are being employed in expansive and creative ways. The result is that the need for MIS professionals has increased \u2013 but in a different way than decades past. MIS is now a \u201cpeople skill\u201d rather than a purely \u201ctechnical skill\u201d. Our MIS program now trains \u201cbusiness analysts\u201d rather than \u201cprogrammers.\u201dThe \u201cbusiness analyst\u201d (or \u201csystems analyst\u201d or \u201cconsultant\u201d) position has become critical in order to make information technology available to more users and solve more business problems. This requires skills in identifying user and consumer problems and translating these needs into technology solutions. The analyst provides this critical connection. This role is not subject to outsourcing because the analyst must be embedded in the organization in order to understand the business user and their needs and be able to design and implement the solution within the confines of the organization\u2019s technology infrastructure. After the entry-level analyst role, most MIS professionals become \u201cproject managers\u201d (or \u201csenior consultants\u201d) where they assume the responsibility for an entire technology project\u2019s: planning; staffing; budgeting; implementation scheduling; training and operational maintenance. After this project management level, the MIS professional will transition into senior technology management roles that involve: technology planning and strategy; technology architectures and infrastructures; corporate wide technology staffing; and the management of various critical technology centers. Finally, at the \u201cC\u201d level, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) represents the pinnacle technology role within most corporate environments.\u00a0\u00a0Advanced MIS Electives - Complete 6.0 credit hours from the following:\u00a0Additional Elective Hours Required:* The 9 hours of General Electives are designated for 6 hours of any unused Component Area Option (090) courses and 3 hours of an unused Social\/Behavioral Science (040) course.

As a science, it is a focus of research through which investigators collect, quantify, analyze, and interpret data describing human and animal behavior, thus shedding light on the causes and dynamics of behavior patterns.
