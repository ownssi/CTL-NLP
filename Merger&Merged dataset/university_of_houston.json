All degree requirements for a declared minor must be satisfied prior to awarding of the degree.Below, is a description of each degree track, followed by a list of course requirements for each degree track.The Public Health Track degree option provides courses required for entry-level public health jobs found in government agencies, health corporations, community non-profit organizations and health care facilities. The Public Health Track consisting of 30 hours of Public Health Track Core courses, combined with required Health Electives, offers numerous strong opportunities to public health majors for employment. It also provides a feeder-program for graduate study in our College of Education programs, local Schools of Public Health, and health professional schools in the Texas Medical Center and statewide.The Health Promotion Track degree option provides courses required for entry-level health promotion jobs found in state\/county health departments, medical facilities, and community organizations. The Health Promotion Track consists of 21 hours of Health Promotion Track Core courses and required Health Electives designed to provide the student with the flexibility to develop areas of individual competencies desirable for future employment. Socio-cultural, behavioral, psychological, and biological factors contributing to wellness and disease are emphasized. It is an ideal major for students interested in public\/community health practice, health behavior research, program planning and delivery, and pre-professional preparation for medicine, pharmacy, optometry, and dentistry.The Health Promotion Track for Allied Health Professionals degree option provides courses required for entry-level health promotion jobs for allied health professionals that promote disease prevention, treatment, and administration and management skills. The Health Promotion for Allied Health Professionals Track consists of 21 hours of Health Promotion for Allied Health Professionals Core courses, required health electives, and 15-30 hours of associate degree transfer credits and approved electives. Students who have completed a two-year associate degree program in an allied health field (e.g., dental hygiene, respiratory therapy, health information technology, speech-language pathology assistant, nursing, occupational therapy assistant, pharmacy technician, radiologic technology, physical therapy) may transfer University core course requirements and advisor-approved courses from their allied health field associate degree. This curriculum provides a program that coordinates well with previous backgrounds and training and allows students to progress to a Bachelor\u2019s\u00a0Degree.The Bachelor of Science degree in Health offers three tracks from which students may choose:* Choose courses from the Core Curriculum List\u00a0.Students completing the Public Health Track Core and Health Electives may be eligible to become Certified Health Education Specialists.(12-18 semester credit hours of which 9 must be advanced)Free Elective denotes that student is free to take any university course that is related to their field of study to fulfill this requirement.

Forecasts are extremely strong with MIS skill sets dominating the top job roles expected to grow in the future. While the MIS careers are expected to expand at an accelerated rate, the mix of skill requirements has changed considerably. With the explosive growth of technology accompanying the usage of the Internet in the late 1990s, the role of application development (programming) dominated the MIS field. Since then, outsourcing has moved many of the low level programming jobs overseas. However, the increased need for higher level technology jobs has become prevalent. Now, the web, communication and database technologies are maturing and their usage has begun to extend throughout every area of business practices. These new information technologies are being employed in expansive and creative ways. The result is that the need for MIS professionals has increased \u2013 but in a different way than decades past. MIS is now a \u201cpeople skill\u201d rather than a purely \u201ctechnical skill\u201d. Our MIS program now trains \u201cbusiness analysts\u201d rather than \u201cprogrammers.\u201dThe \u201cbusiness analyst\u201d (or \u201csystems analyst\u201d or \u201cconsultant\u201d) position has become critical in order to make information technology available to more users and solve more business problems. This requires skills in identifying user and consumer problems and translating these needs into technology solutions. The analyst provides this critical connection. This role is not subject to outsourcing because the analyst must be embedded in the organization in order to understand the business user and their needs and be able to design and implement the solution within the confines of the organization\u2019s technology infrastructure. After the entry-level analyst role, most MIS professionals become \u201cproject managers\u201d (or \u201csenior consultants\u201d) where they assume the responsibility for an entire technology project\u2019s: planning; staffing; budgeting; implementation scheduling; training and operational maintenance. After this project management level, the MIS professional will transition into senior technology management roles that involve: technology planning and strategy; technology architectures and infrastructures; corporate wide technology staffing; and the management of various critical technology centers.
