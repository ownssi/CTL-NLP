The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:\n\n\n\nTo give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on ancient Mediterranean culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.\nTo enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Ancient Greek and Roman Civilizations, Greek, and Latin. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in classics, comparative literature, philosophy, and other fields.\n\n\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\n\nAcquire a basic understanding of ancient Greek and Latin texts (in translation) and\/or material culture, including major monuments, sites, and works of art.\u00a0\nDemonstrate advanced knowledge of one or more subjects related to Ancient Greece and\/or Rome (art and archaeology, history and culture, philosophy or Greek language, or Latin language).\nLearn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.\nGain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.\nDemonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.\nDemonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.\n\n\n\n","anthropology":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\n\nLearning About Anthropology\n\t\nUnderstand core concepts in contemporary biological anthropology.\nUnderstand core concepts in contemporary anthropological archaeology.\nUnderstand core concepts in contemporary sociocultural anthropology, including medical anthropology.\nDevelop understanding of the history of anthropological thought.\nGain experience in fieldwork and the application of theory and methodology.\nDevelop understanding of the anthropological analysis of visual media and language.\n\n\nCritical Thinking, Communication, and Analytical Goals\n\t\nEncourage critical abilities in the analysis of evolutionary, historical, and contemporary situations.\nDevelop the ability to analyze comprehensively and critically scholarly articles and monographs.\nDevelop facility in conveying anthropological concepts and debates to public audiences.\nFormulate well-organized written and oral arguments supported by evidence.\n\n\nLearning About the World\n\t\nUnderstand the structure and transformation of society and culture past and present.\nAnalyze regional and cultural diversity in the organization of human societies and the impact of cultural contacts and globalization.\nIntegrate biological and cultural perspectives on human behavior, social organization, and the environment.\nUtilize anthropological concepts and methods to understand the history and forms of diversity in US society.\n\n\n\n\n\n","applied-mathematics":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nMathematics is the language of science. In Galileo\u2019s words:\n\n\n\nPhilosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is impossible to understand a single word of it. Without those, one is wandering in a dark labyrinth.\n\n\n\nMathematics majors learn the internal workings of this language, its central concepts and their interconnections. These involve structures going far beyond the geometric figures to which Galileo refers. Majors also learn to use mathematical concepts to formulate, analyze, and solve real-world problems. Their training in rigorous thought and creative problem-solving is valuable not just in science, but in all walks of life.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nBy the time of graduation, majors should have acquired the following knowledge and skills:\n\n\n\nAnalytical skills\n\t\nAn understanding of the basic rules of logic.\nThe ability to distinguish a coherent argument from a fallacious one, both in mathematical reasoning and in everyday life.\nAn understanding of the role of axioms or assumptions.\nThe ability to abstract general principles from examples.\n\n\nProblem-solving and modeling skills (important for all, but especially for majors in Applied Mathematics)\n\t\nThe ability to recognize which real-world problems are subject to mathematical reasoning.\nThe ability to make vague ideas precise by representing them in mathematical notation, when appropriate.\nTechniques for solving problems expressed in mathematical notation.\n\n\nCommunication skills\n\t\nThe ability to formulate a mathematical statement precisely.\nThe ability to write a coherent proof.\nThe ability to present a mathematical argument verbally.\nMajors in Mathematics with a Teaching Concentration should acquire familiarity with techniques for explaining K-12 mathematics in an accessible and mathematically correct manner.\n\n\nReading and research skills\n\t\nSufficient experience in mathematical language and foundational material to be well-prepared to extend one\u2019s mathematical knowledge further through independent reading.\nExposure to and successful experience in solving mathematical problems presenting substantial intellectual challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n","architecture":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nUndergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI)\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Learning Initiative (USLI) is a campuswide initiative to support departments in establishing educational goals and evaluation procedures for all undergraduate programs. As a result of the initiative, faculty and students have a shared understanding of the purpose of the major and what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study. The initiative is in keeping with the fundamental principle at Berkeley that the evaluation of student achievement should be locally defined, discipline specific, and faculty-driven.\n\n\nDepartment of Architecture Statement of Goals\n\n\nThe Underlying Goals of a Liberal Arts Undergraduate Education\n\n\nIn its recent curriculum discussions, the faculty strongly supports a liberal arts education for undergraduates that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the department is that all courses are framed with this perspective. In addition to this goal, the department is introducing students to the discipline specific areas of knowledge that are needed by students who apply for graduate school in architecture.\n\n\nThe Discipline-Specific Knowledge of Architecture\n\n\nThe discipline of architecture covers a wide range of discipline-specific subject areas that are integrated in the process of design.\n\n\nThe goal of the undergraduate major is to make students familiar with and curious about engagement in and production of the built environment in historical, critical, technical, and social dimensions. The possibilities open to graduates in the major are broad, and this challenges the department to locate the terrain that is common to various aspects of the discipline as a formulation of the core lower division courses, and then to offer at the upper division a set of \u201cstreams\u201d of study, each of which inspires and prepares students to pursue a future endeavor. As these future endeavors cover a wide range of possibilities, there are several ways to view the undergraduate major: as a liberal arts education through the lens of architecture, perhaps leading to another course of study; as preparation for work in the profession with only an undergraduate degree; and as preparation for follow-up study at the graduate level in the discipline of architecture. Acceptance into strong graduate architecture programs requires a high level of proficiency in the core areas of the curriculum. In recent debates on the undergraduate curriculum, the faculty decided that the undergraduate major should continue to provide courses appropriate for students on each of these paths.\n\n\nThe curriculum exposes students to five aspects of architecture and the broader field of environmental design:\n\n\n\nThe Language of Architecture\n\tIn essence, the language most particular to architecture is a graphic vocabulary that is the currency of exploration in the design studio. The mastery of this language, like the learning of any language, begins with vocabulary and grammar, and then moves on to the construction of meaning. This latter aspect is rigorously pursued in the design studio, and for those planning to go on to graduate study in architecture, a number of these upper level studios offer an increasingly complex set of design challenges.\n\tIn the Language of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nUnderstand the conventions of plan, section, elevation, and axonometric and their relationship to each other;\nUnderstand and become proficient in hand drawings and the use of digital media in the production of these conventions;\nUnderstand and become proficient in three or four digital programs that allow a facile exploration of design ideas;\nBecome proficient in the production of design iterations; and\nApply critical discussion to design solutions and representation.\n\n\nThe History and Theory of Architecture\n\tCourses in history and theory are intended to familiarize students with the development of the built environment in both western and eastern traditions, and to introduce recent and current theories of local and global importance. The introductory surveys in architectural history test students to both recognize and classify architectural styles; these courses are complemented by others that focus on the intersection of history and theory, and for which the writing of papers is the primary means of evaluation.\n\tIn the History and Theory of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nArticulate the theoretical concepts within the design studio projects;\nUnderstand the major periods and styles in architectural history;\nUnderstand the modern period, and its current debates; and\nWrite critical papers comparing and contrasting both buildings and ideas.\n\n\nThe Humanistic Applications of Architecture\n\tMany students enter this field of study in hopes of improving the conditions of the built environment as it relates to the daily life of individuals and communities. An emphasis in these aspects of the major can lead to graduate work in other disciplines, including environmental studies, law, global development and planning, and anthropology, or to a PhD program in architecture.\n\tIn the Humanistic Applications of Architecture, students should learn to:\n\t\nUnderstand the roles and responsibilities of the environmental professions;\nUnderstand the art and science of interpreting the social context of design;\nIdentify the major issues of environmental design in the national and global setting; and\nRecognize the value of addressing sustainability at all levels of design.\n\n\nThe Science and Technology of Architecture\n\tHow buildings stand up, how they operate to distribute and control light and air, and the materials and connections with which they are made bring the understanding of the discipline from its paper representations of design and theory into the physical world. A set of core courses introduces students to the fundamentals of these areas, and a set of upper division seminars allows more in-depth explorations of aspects of each, including the testing of structural ideas through design, current attitudes and goals for a sustainable building culture, and construction practices particular to certain materials or cultures.\u00a0\n\tIn the Science and Technology of Architecture, student should learn to:\n\t\nEvaluate building performance through modes of calculation;\nFamiliarize themselves with the major groups of construction systems;\nIntegrate these concepts into the design studio; and\nFamiliarize themselves with the major debates in the literature of these areas.\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\tStudents should become proficient in the processes of academic research, learning to:\n\t\nUndertake library and on-line research and follow source threads to both books and periodicals;\nConstruct bibliographies to academic standards;\nDocument various methods of research; and\nUnderstand taxonomies of knowledge and organize information.\n\n\n\n\n\n","art-history":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nLower Division:\n\n\n\nStudents are introduced to principles of visual analysis.\nLearn to think about images within a historical and cultural context.\nLearn to craft coherent arguments about works of art by integrating visual analysis with historical\/cultural context.\nDevelop familiarity with specific sites, objects, artists, cultures, and facts pertaining to them.\nStudents learn to understand techniques and skills used in the creation of works of art.\n\n\n\nUpper Division:\n\n\n\nStudents\u2019 skills in all of the above are reinforced.\nThey learn to analyze key texts relating to the artworks under discussion.\nWrite longer papers that include research.\nUnderstand in depth the dynamic relationship between visual art and its historical, social, cultural, economic, and political contexts.\nIn small seminars, students pursue independent research projects.\nUndertake intensive interrogations of particular problems in the history of art.\nIn History of Art courses,\u00a0HISTART\u00a0100\u00a0and HISTART\u00a0101, students come to understand the history and tools of the discipline.\n\n\n\n","asian-american-diaspora-studies":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nUndergraduates are expected to obtain the following skills by the time they graduate.

Few European countries have as profound a colonial legacy as the Netherlands. Today, a large percentage of the Dutch population has roots in former Dutch colonies. Some of the most interesting world literature has been written in the former Dutch East Indies and in the Dutch-speaking Caribbean. Traces of Dutch influence can be found all over the world, from Japan and Indonesia to South Africa to the United States, where the roots of present-day New York City go back to the former Dutch colony of New Netherland.\n\n\nDutch Politics are World Politics\n\t\nDutch Studies offers a critical reflection on the political past and present of the Netherlands, including the long-term effects of the Dutch involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, the impact of Dutch colonialism in the Americas, Africas, and Asia, or the history of the Jewish minority in the Netherlands, from Sephardic Jewish immigrants in the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic to the tragic fate of Anne Frank in World War II. We also pay attention to Belgium and the important role of its bilingual (French and Dutch) capital Brussels, also the capital of the European Union.\n\n\nDutch Economy is a World Economy\n\t\nDutch Studies pays attention to the economic importance of the Netherlands and the BENELUX area, historically known as the Low Countries.

Europe\u2019s two largest seaports are located in the Low Countries (Rotterdam and Antwerp).\n\n\nDutch Culture is a World Culture\n\t\nDutch Studies offers a profound study of the cultural importance of the Low Countries. The singular development of the Netherlands has been accompanied by splendid cultural achievements in painting, book printing, architecture, and literature right through contemporary dance and design. Dutch culture is represented by several of the world\u2019s most famous painters, from Van Eyck to Rembrandt and from Vermeer to Van Gogh.\n\n\nDutch Language is a World Language\n\t\nDutch studies offers four levels of Dutch language acquisition from introductory to advanced Dutch as well as a course on Dutch for Reading Knowledge. While Dutch is the mother tongue of approximately 24 million people in Europe (some 17.5 million people in the Netherlands and 6.5 million people in Flanders), it is also spoken by approximately half a million people in the Caribbean and, although in a creolized variant known as Afrikaans, by some 6 million people in South Africa. Due to its colonial legacy, knowledge of Dutch language proves to be of essential importance for scholars interested in the history of Japan, South- and Southeast Asia, South Africa, the Caribbean, and New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","electrical-engineering-computer-sciences-business-administration":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\n\n\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Sciences\n\n\nMission\n\n\n\nPreparing graduates to pursue postgraduate education in electrical engineering, computer science, or related fields.\nPreparing graduates for success in technical careers related to electrical and computer engineering, or computer science and engineering.\nPreparing graduates to become leaders in fields related to electrical and computer engineering or computer science and engineering.\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\n\nECE\n\n\n\n\nAn ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.\nAn ability to configure, apply test conditions, and evaluate outcomes of experimental systems.\nAn ability to design systems, components, or processes that conform to given specifications and cost constraints.\nAn ability to work cooperatively, respectfully, creatively, and responsibly as a member of a team.\nAn ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.\nAn understanding of the norms of expected behavior in engineering practice and their underlying ethical foundations.\nAn ability to communicate effectively by oral, written, and graphical means.\nAn awareness of global and societal concerns and their importance in developing engineering solutions.\nAn ability to independently acquire and apply required information, and an appreciation of the associated process of life-long learning.\nA knowledge of contemporary issues.\nAn in-depth ability to use a combination of software, instrumentation, and experimental techniques practiced in circuits, physical electronics, communication, networks and systems, hardware, programming, and computer science theory.\n\n\n\n\nCSE\n\n\n\nAn ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the program\u2019s student outcomes and to the discipline.\nAn ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.\nAn ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.\nAn ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal.\nAn understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities.\nAn ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.\nAn ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.\nRecognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development.\n\u00a0An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.\n\n\n\nBusiness Administration\n\n\nMission\n\n\nGuided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business\u00a0is\u00a0to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.\n\n\nThe Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school\u2019s mission.\n\n\nThe learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes.

Engineering\n\n\nMISSION\n\n\nThe mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.\n\n\nLEARNING GOALS\n\n\nThe foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.\n\n\nNuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:\n\n\n\nApply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.\nDemonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and\/or future importance to society.\nExhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and\u00a0problem-solving\u00a0skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.\nDemonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.\nValue and practice life-long learning.\n\n\n\n","economics":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nMission\n\n\nEconomics is the study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity and the results of those choices for society. Limited resources make tradeoffs necessary for consumers, businesses, and nations. Microeconomics studies how consumers make choices in using their time and spending their income and how businesses make choices in producing and selling goods and services. Macroeconomics studies the determination of national income and how it deviates from its potential (full employment) over the business cycle. The important outcomes for the national economy are income and how it is distributed, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and how well financial markets and international trade are functioning. Economics is important in studying the impact of government policies, ranging from regulatory activities in individual markets to general measures for stabilizing and steering the economy at large. The effect of alternative economic policies on the welfare of the population is a core concern in economics. Undergraduates should have the following knowledge and skills when they graduate with an economics major from UC Berkeley. The Department of Economics wants their majors to have knowledge of economics principles with the skills to apply this knowledge in the following ways.\n\n\nLearning Goals of the Major\n\n\nCritical Thinking Skills\n\n\n\nApply economic analysis to evaluate everyday problems.\nApply economic analysis to evaluate specific policy proposals.\nCompare two or more arguments that have different conclusions to a specific issue or problem.\nUnderstand the role of assumptions in arguments.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Reasoning Skills\n\n\n\nUnderstand how to use empirical evidence to evaluate an economic argument.\nInterpret statistical results.\nConduct appropriate statistical analysis of data and explain the statistical problems involved.\nObtain and\/or collect relevant data using specific qualitative and\/or quantitative research methods.\n\n\n\nProblem-Solving Skills\n\n\n\nSolve problems that have clear solutions.\nPropose solutions for problems that do not have clear answers and indicate under what conditions they may be viable solutions.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Knowledge and Application of Skills\n\n\n\nIn specific content areas (fields) of economics, develop deeper critical and quantitative thinking skills, and apply problem-solving skills to complex problems.\n\n\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n\n\nCommunicate effectively in written, spoken, and graphical form about specific economic issues.\nFormulate a well-organized written argument that states assumptions and hypotheses, which are supported by evidence.\nPresent an economic argument orally.\n\n\n\nLifelong Learning Skills\n\n\n\nPossess a working knowledge of information databases (e.g., Econ Lit, Nexis-Lexis).\nKnow how to locate and use primary data sources (e.g., BLS Household Survey, UN Human Development Index).\nUnderstand and evaluate current economic events and new economic ideas.\n\n\n\n","ecosystem-management-forestry":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nMission\n\n\nThe Ecosystem Management and Forestry (EMF) major at the University of California at Berkeley is designed to train tomorrow\u2019s leaders in ecosystem science, policy, and management with an emphasis on the ecology, stewardship, and management of forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems. \u00a0The program combines a foundation in the relevant natural and social sciences with explicit hands-on learning opportunities.

This track affords a strong foundation in the processes that shape the earth; it emphasizes quantitative understanding and a solid understanding of the physical sciences. Courses in the department emphasize expertise in laboratory skills, field observation, oral student presentations and many involve research projects.\n\n\nThe Geology track is versatile: it is an excellent background for graduate work, and it satisfies the minimum academic requirement for registration as a geologist in the State of California. Students learn from both a theoretical and a practical perspective, through field trips, in courses and through a four-week long summer camp. In summer camp students spend the entire time in the field, making observations, mapping, and interpreting a technical report that describes your findings in relation to published literature on the area.\n\n\n","geophysics":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nMission\n\n\nThe goal of the Earth and Planetary Science (EPS) BA degree is to provide students with a broad and sound education that provides general and specialized knowledge and is intellectually challenging and stimulating.

Because most of the Earth's interior is inaccessible to direct observation, the geophysicist uses the basic principles of physics to devise indirect methods of exploring those parts of the Earth that cannot be reached by shovel or drill bit. Measurements of magnetic fields, electric potential, gravity, seismic waves, and satellite-based geodesy are used to probe the interior and study surface and internal processes of our planet, and to answer questions concerning how continents move, mountains form, earthquakes shake, and volcanoes erupt, as well as improving our understanding of planetary to local scale structure and processes. These questions require an interdisciplinary approach that links the disciplines of mathematics, physics, geology, and chemistry. Moreover, the geophysics study encompasses theoretical and experimental science as well as fieldwork to study geodynamic processes and the structure of the Earth and other planets, and employed methods are used for identification and recovery of natural resources, the characterization of natural hazards from earthquakes and volcanoes, and are used for environmental studies and remediation.\n\n\n","german":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\n\n\nMission\nThe Bachelor\u2019s Degree Program offers a comprehensive education in German Studies.

The Legal Studies curriculum examines how law shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces. The major is designed to stimulate critical understanding of and inquiry about the theoretical frameworks, historical dynamics, and cultural embeddedness of law.\n\n\nThe Legal Studies faculty and students grapple with important questions of social policy within the framework of significant concerns in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These concerns include individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy; political and social equality; the just distribution of resources and opportunities within society; the relationship between citizens and the state; democratic participation and representation; the moral commitments of the community; and the preservation of human dignity.\n\n\nThe major\u2019s course offerings examine law and legality from both humanist and empirical perspectives. Courses are organized into interdisciplinary topical areas that transcend disciplinary boundaries in the interest of collaborative inquiry.\n\n\nLegal Studies\u2019 Pedagogic Objectives\n\n\nConvey how law relates to social context: \u00a0Students will learn about the transformation of legal processes and systems across time and space (e.g., globalization, transnational processes). They will also study how law shapes and is shaped by economic, political, and cultural forces, as well as how and why law in action often differs from legal doctrine.\n\n\nAdopt an explicitly interdisciplinary approach:\u00a0 Students will focus on pervasive problems of legal and social policy across traditional curricular and disciplinary boundaries. Although the program encompasses multiple disciplinary perspectives (e.g., history, economics, sociology), it is designed to transcend academic identities rather than compartmentalize the study of law into the discrete perspectives of established disciplines. To accomplish this integration, the major is organized around areas of focus that explore common themes but include coursework across disciplinary boundaries.\n\n\nIntegrate empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives: Students will be exposed to both empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives on law and legal institutions through distribution requirements within the major. Empirical perspectives encompass public policy analysis, training in the epistemological commitments of social science (e.g., empirical methods, the logic of social inquiry), and familiarity with the central questions and tenets related to law in disciplines such as economics, sociology, and political science. Humanities perspectives include maintaining the program\u2019s historical focus on clarifying fundamental values, examining philosophical questions related to law, and understanding the operation and effects of social and cultural practices as they relate to law, legal institutions, and the phenomenon they regulate. After students fulfill the basic distribution requirements, they may, but will not be required to, concentrate their efforts in either empirical or humanities-oriented perspectives.\n\n\nPromote engagement with social policy: Students will be encouraged to engage deeply with social policy guided by significant themes in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These themes include individual liberty, privacy, democracy, and the relationship between the citizen and the state. Engaging with these themes ensures that policy studies are basic and critical, rather than confined to preexisting policy formulations and assumptions. This new objective of engagement with social policy is intended to connect humanistic inquiries regarding justice, morality, and values, with empirical inquiries into patterns of social behavior and the effects of law on society. This goal will be accomplished through both coursework and field work options.\n\n\nEncourage civic engagement and an appreciation of the values at stake in legal concerns:\u00a0 Consistent with the mission of a public university, the major will develop informed and engaged citizens with sufficient knowledge and background to participate in civic institutions and the development of law and policy during and after their education at Berkeley. This participation could take many forms, including interacting with public officials, joining the legal profession, working for legal institutions, engaging in policy analysis, advocacy, social movement building, community organizing, political activism, and the like. Civic engagement includes confronting the relationship between law and justice, and understanding how law affects the public interest and social utility.\n\n\nProvide a liberal arts education: The major will continue to have a liberal arts orientation. Students will learn to analyze and understand legal rules and legal institutions, but from a broader perspective than is typically taught in a traditional law school setting.\n\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nThe faculty strongly supports an undergraduate liberal arts education that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the program is that courses be framed with this perspective. In addition, the program is committed to introducing students to multiple disciplinary approaches to the study of law and legal institutions, as well as conveying important basic knowledge about the core features of the American legal system.\n\n\nCritical Thinking Skills\n\n\nIn concert with the goals identified above, these critical thinking skills focus on particular forms of analysis central to engaging with law and legal institutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\n\n\n\nIdentify and evaluate arguments, synthesize ideas, and develop well-substantiated, coherent, and concise arguments, whether in oral or written form.\nIdentify and follow a logical sequence or argument through to its end; recognize faulty reasoning.\nDevelop the ability to critically evaluate proposed legal reforms and policies.\nDevelop the ability to formulate generalized, abstract principles in a way that clarifies the major issues at stake and identifies the most relevant elements of a concept or text.\nPromote exploration of the role of law in American society from both social science and humanities perspectives.\nLearn to draw from multiple disciplinary approaches and fields of study across philosophy, history, economics, political science, and sociology; synthesize, bridge, and question disciplinary boundaries to identify new inquiries or insights.\n\n\n\nBasic Knowledge about Law and Legal Institutions\n\n\nThese goals address important basic knowledge about law and legal institutions that the program seeks to convey. These goals are not intended to provide a pre-professional education but instead to produce citizens literate in the basic functions and structure of legal systems.\n\n\n\nUnderstand core theories about the relationship between law and society.\nBe introduced to core features of the American legal system.\nUnderstand basic legal terminology, legal concepts, legal actors, and modes of legal reasoning.\nBecome acquainted with legal systems other than our own, including how they compare to the current American legal system.\nDevelop insights into how law has evolved through time, including the temporal and geographical transformation of legal processes and systems.\n\n\n\nEngaged Citizenship\n\n\nThe faculty believes that our role as a program in a public institution should include training students to be engaged, active, and critical citizens in our society. Many legal studies students engage in civic participation and service while at Berkeley, and many go on to careers in public service. We seek to develop more opportunities for students to develop practical skills and knowledge relevant to those experiences in addition to the broader intellectual skills conveyed by a liberal arts education.\n\n\n\nExperience the law in action through service learning, exposure to legal clinics, problem solving, and social policy engagement.\nEnable civic engagement and participation in developing and critiquing social policy.\n\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nA key part of a liberal arts education is learning how to conduct independent research and analysis. The program seeks to expose students to a multidisciplinary range of methods of research.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nDevelop an understanding of methods of research and forms of evidence across multiple disciplines.\nDevelop skills necessary to find and to assess relevant jurisprudential, social science, and humanities materials related to law and legal institutions.\nDevelop basic abilities in statistical analysis and reasoning.\nUnderstand the logic of inquiry in the social sciences.\n\n\n\nHumanities\n\n\n(Defined as philosophy, political theory, and history.)\n\n\n\u00a0These goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the humanities as they relate to law and legal institutions.\n\n\n\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on fundamental normative concepts such as fairness, due process, equality, and utility.\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on rights, duties, punishment, and justice.\nEncourage understanding of and reflection on the ethical dimensions of the relationship between citizens and the state, and the forms and limits of sovereignty.\nUnderstand the historical contexts and forces within which legal systems operate and how legal systems influence history and societies.\n\n\n\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n(Defined as sociology, political science, psychology and economics.)\n\n\nThese goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the social sciences as they relate to law and legal institutions.\n\n\n\nDevelop the ability to connect theory about law and legal institutions with empirical predictions about the state of the world and to evaluate those predictions with data.\nUnderstand how, and why, the law in action often differs from the law on the books.\nDevelop an expansive understanding of the social contexts in which law and legal institutions can be studied empirically.\n\n\n\nPlease visit our website at http:\/\/legalstudies.berkeley.edu\n\n\n","linguistics":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nLearning Goals of the Major\n\n\nIn addition to attaining a basic mastery of the field of linguistics, linguistics majors develop skills in critical thinking, communication, and the use of research methodologies. The array of courses offered by the department includes both the required core courses in phonetics and phonology, syntax and semantics, morphology and historical linguistics, and a broad range of electives. The core courses allow linguistics majors to master the basics of the discipline, such as the nature of sounds and sound systems, the nature of word structures and syntactic structures, the interaction of syntax and semantics, and the nature of linguistic change, while the elective courses allow students to investigate areas of particular interest. Students learn to apply problem-solving skills in each of these areas. Perhaps more importantly, a linguistics major develops critical thinking skills. By graduation, linguistics majors can employ both theory and empirical evidence in order to evaluate different linguistic arguments, analyze complex linguistic patterns, and understand the role played by assumptions in argumentation. Furthermore, linguistics majors develop advanced verbal skills: they are able to communicate effectively in oral and written form about specific linguistic issues, and they can produce well-organized oral presentations and original written reports supported by empirical evidence. These skills do not disappear at graduation. No matter what profession a linguistics major decides to pursue, throughout a lifetime s\/he will possess a working knowledge of sources of reliable information about languages and linguistics and will be able to understand and evaluate current linguistic issues in the world at large. Below is a list of more specific skills.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\nCritical Thinking Skills\n\n\n\nApply linguistic analysis to evaluate specific theoretical proposals.\nCompare two or more arguments that have different conclusions to a specific issue or problem.\nUnderstand the role of assumptions in argumentation.\nBe able to analyze complex linguistic patterns.\n\n\n\nResearch Methodologies\n\n\nObtain and collect relevant data using specific qualitative and\/or quantitative research methods.

This initiative is designed to promote and facilitate learning for undergraduates across campus. In connection with this initiative, the Philosophy Department has articulated the following goals for our undergraduate majors.\n\n\nThe primary goal that we expect our undergraduate philosophy majors to achieve is to become capable of engaging with the main topics and issues in contemporary academic philosophy and with the historical tradition by which contemporary philosophy is informed. Students who graduate from our program should be able to think both analytically and creatively about philosophical issues and texts. They should be able to analyse and raise objections to philosophical views and arguments that are presented to them, and to develop and defend their own views on philosophical topics. They should be able to do this both in writing and in oral discussion with other students and with instructors. Achieving these objectives requires that students acquire more general skills in writing, reading, and oral argument: they need to be able to organize their ideas, express them clearly both in writing and in speaking, and construct plausible arguments in their defense.\n\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\n\nThis primary goal includes the following more specific goals:\n\n\n\nA broad general understanding of the work of major figures in the history of philosophy, including Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant.\nA deeper and more detailed understanding of the work of at least two historically important philosophers.\nFamiliarity with the most important topics in a range of areas which are typically regarded as lying at the center of contemporary philosophical thought, including metaphysics, theory of knowledge, philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.\nFamiliarity with the most important topics in ethics and the related field of political philosophy.\nFamiliarity with formal logic, including both the ability to understand the logical symbolism used in many contemporary philosophical texts, and to carry out logical proofs and derivations within a formal system.\nThe general capacity to think analytically and creatively about philosophical texts and issues.\nThe general capacity to express philosophical ideas and defend them effectively in argument, both in writing and orally.\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nStudents\u2019 attainment of these goals is measured by assessment of their performance in the courses required for the major. All philosophy undergraduate courses, with the exception of those in logic, require students to write several essays over the course of the semester; many of them also require a final exam where the questions also take the form of short philosophical essays. These essays are evaluated by the instructor with an eye both to the student\u2019s mastery of the specific subject matter covered by the course, and to the student\u2019s mastery of more general skills in philosophical thinking and writing. A higher standard of thinking and writing is required for upper division than for lower division courses. More ambitious students have the option of taking graduate seminars as electives, where the standard for philosophical writing is higher still.\n\n\nIn logic courses, students\u2019 competence in formal logic is evaluated through assessment of their performance in weekly problem sets and examinations (typically including a midterm and a final).\n\n\nAll of our courses, again with the exception of those in formal logic, require students to engage in oral philosophical discussion, typically during sections taught by graduate student instructors. In many courses, students\u2019 contributions to discussion are assessed as part of the overall assessment of their performance in the class. We recognize it as a shortcoming in our program, however, that our courses are often too large to allow much discussion, and as a result, we are not confident that all of our students do in fact become proficient in this aspect of the primary goal of the program. We think it very important that students have the opportunity to develop their skills in oral discussion of philosophical issues, and we are hoping to be able to introduce as a requirement that students take one undergraduate seminar which offers ample opportunity for discussion with a faculty member and with their peers. So far, the small size of the faculty compared with the large size of enrollment in philosophy classes has prevented us from doing this, but we hope that faculty size will increase to a degree that will make this change in the program feasible.\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\nStudents are required to take 12 courses overall, including a number of required courses; these required courses are selected and designed with reference to the specific goals from the numbered list above, as follows:\n\n\n\nGoal 1: PHILOS\u00a025A\u00a0and PHILOS\u00a025B (both required)\nGoal 2: Courses in the 160-187 sequence (two of these required)\nGoal 3: PHILOS\u00a0122, PHILOS\u00a0125, PHILOS\u00a0131, PHILOS\u00a0132, and PHILOS\u00a0135\u00a0(two of these required)\nGoal 4: PHILOS\u00a0104, PHILOS\u00a0105, PHILOS\u00a0107, PHILOS\u00a0115 (one of these required)\nGoal 5: PHILOS\u00a012A (required)\nGoal 6: All of our courses, except for those in formal logic\nGoal 7: All of our courses (except for those in formal logic), but especially PHILOS\u00a0100, which is a dedicated course in philosophical writing\n\n\n\nThe goals described in this statement will be communicated to our undergraduate students by posting a prominent link to this statement on our department website, on the same page that is used to inform students about the course requirements for the philosophy major.\n\n\n","physics":"\n\n\nStudent Learning Goals\nMission\n\n\nThe goal of the Physics major is to provide students with a broad understanding of the physical principles of the universe, to help them develop critical thinking and quantitative reasoning skills, to empower them to think creatively and critically about scientific problems and experiments, and to provide training for students planning careers in physics and in the physical sciences broadly defined including those whose interests lie in research, K-12 or college teaching, industrial jobs, or other sectors of society.\n\n\nPhysics majors complete a program which includes foundational lower division course work in math and physics and in-depth upper division course work. These topics are traditionally broadly divided into classical and modern physics. Some core topics, such as special relativity, classical optics, and classical thermodynamics, are covered only in lower division courses. Other topics, such as quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and optics, are covered first at an introductory level in lower division and then at a more advanced level in the upper division courses. Advanced elective courses provide students the opportunity to further their knowledge in specific areas (such as atomic physics, condensed matter physics, optical properties, quantum computing, biophysics, astrophysics, particle physics). A two-semester upper division laboratory course provides additional training in electronic instrumentation, circuits, computer interfacing to experiments, independent project design, and advanced laboratory techniques experiments. This laboratory course also provides the capstone experience to the core courses, bringing the knowledge gained in different courses together and making the connection between theoretical knowledge taught in textbooks\/homework problems and the experimental foundations of this knowledge. Activities outside the classroom, such as independent research or study, allow students to further develop their knowledge and understanding.\n\n\nA student graduating from Berkeley with a major in physics will understand classical and modern physics (as outlined in the course requirements below) and will also acquire the skills to apply principles to new and unfamiliar problems.
