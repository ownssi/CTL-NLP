How has public discourse influenced culture? What are the effects of image-based communication?","Computer Science":"Consider a major in computer science, the formal study of abstract problem-solving. Computers permeate every facet of our society, so more and more careers relate to them: bioinformatics, cognitive science, digital media arts, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, management information systems, human-computer interaction, and intellectual property law. In fact, all fields and organizations welcome the talents of properly trained computer scientists. Learn how to organize and communicate information, use algorithms, procedures or formulas for solving problems, and work with a team to find practical applications.","Data Analytics":"\u00a0Professors in the mathematics, computer science, and economics and business departments collaborated in creating this interdisciplinary major in the context of a liberal arts program to provide a more humanistic perspective.

Our graduates have become leaders in a wide range of industries worldwide, from Fortune 500 companies to Silicon Valley start-ups to non-profit organizations.\u00a0","Engineering":"Deeply grounded in the liberal arts, our new engineering program blends a mix of courses in engineering, physics, mathematics, and chemistry. We seek to equip our graduates to find innovative solutions to enduring problems by cultivating collaboration, problem-solving and moral discernment. Increasingly, solutions to local and global challenges require insights from engineers, especially when addressing social mobility, caring for the environment, reducing poverty and promoting human welfare. Our graduates will benefit from thorough technical and scientific training and the interdisciplinary sensitivity and moral imagination of the Christian liberal arts. We've embraced the challenge from the National Science Foundation to prepare adaptive engineers committed to blending science, engineering and the arts.\u00a0Westmont Engineering is distinctive in many ways. Our program is built around three pillars:Excellence in technical engineering training learned in small classes, focused on hands-on active learning, with professors that are very engaged with their studentsIntegration of Engineering Design and Innovation throughout the curriculumA solid Christian liberal arts foundationWestmont Engineering grants a BS in General Engineering that provides the largest set of possibilities for specialization, job opportunities and graduate school options. Our curriculum starts with our Christian liberal arts core and then combines a solid math and science foundation with in-depth content in all the critical technical areas of engineering. Our small class sizes (average engineering class size is about 10 students) are taught by Christian faculty who are experts in their fields. The small class sizes provide great opportunities for \u201clearning by doing\u201d, where we emphasize hands-on, design-oriented experiences that make the technical content come to life. In addition, the small classes allow you to really get to know your professors.Our focus on engineering design and on innovation also distinguishes our program. Design is what differentiates engineering from other technical disciplines. Engineers create (design) products, processes and services to help people. This fits seamlessly into our Christian distinctiveness as we endeavor to love people by designing to help them live better lives. Westmont engineering has multiple courses where Design Innovation (DI) plays a central role. These courses include the first-year class \u201cEngineering and the Liberal Arts\u201d, the \u201cJunior Design\u201d class which focuses on designing to serve others and the 2-semester Senior Capstone Design courses where we work on industry sponsored projects. In addition, the Westmont Engineering curriculum weaves DI throughout the engineering curriculum by including mini design experiences that use the technical content for that course in a design experience.The Christian liberal arts foundation of our engineering program provides a wonderful base for our engineering graduates to excel in their careers. While engineering practice requires great technical competence, engineering industry is increasingly demanding the thoughtfulness and skill set that a Christian liberal arts emphasis provides. Skills such as leadership, teamwork, conflict management skills, interpersonal skills, empathy and negotiation, as well as written and oral communication skills are seen as critical for successful engineering work.Westmont Engineering works to integrate our professional endeavors with our faith experience.\u00a0This is especially true as we creatively design things that help improve people\u2019s lives. As Christian engineers, this aligns with Christ\u2019s command to \u201clove others as ourselves\u201d (Matt. 22:39). \u00a0In particular, our junior design course has an emphasis on \u201cdesigning for service\u201d.Engineering graduates have tremendous opportunities across a broad range of possibilities.\u00a0Engineers have opportunities in industries such as design, energy, sustainability, environmental resources, robotics, automation, vehicle design, aeronautics, space, manufacturing and internet of things (IoT).\u00a0International opportunities are available both during the time at Westmont and after graduation. Opportunities for females and ethnic minorities are especially abundant. In addition to all the engineering-specific highlights of the Westmont Engineering program detailed above, our students have the privilege of living in beautiful Santa Barbara, CA.\u00a0Living just minutes from both the beach and the mountains is quite a thrill!\u00a0Being just far enough from Los Angeles to avoid the traffic, but close enough to go enjoy the big city when you want to, is also wonderful.Designing a Strong and Innovative Engineering ProgramProposed Building to House Engineering","Engineering Physics":"Physicists seek a fundamental understanding of the physical universe. Engineers apply scientific knowledge to design and develop structures, machines and products. Students may pursue the engineering physics major with an emphasis in either area. The physics emphasis stresses fundamental science and mathematics essential for graduate study or professional work in physics. The engineering emphasis, while not a formal engineering program, provides a strong conceptual base for an engineering career. In addition the 3-2 dual-degree program allows for a full engineering program.","English":"Go beyond required composition and literature courses into a department rich in writing and globally conscious literary study.
